Herein I document the configurations I utilise with [[https://gnu.org/s/emacs][Emacs]].
# After cloning the file, many packages are automatically installed; usually with
# little or no trouble.

As a [[https://www.offerzen.com/blog/literate-programming-empower-your-writing-with-emacs-org-mode][literate program]] file with [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], I am ensured optimal navigation
through my ever growing configuration files, ease of usability and reference
for peers, and, most importantly, better maintainability for myself!

Dear reader, when encountering a foregin command ~X~ I encourage you to execute ~(describe-symbol 'X)~, or press ~C-h o~ with the cursor on ~X~.
An elementary Elisp Cheat Sheet can be found [[https://github.com/alhassy/ElispCheatSheet][here]]
and here is a 2-page 3-column [[https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Emacs Cheat Sheet]] of the bindings
in ~“this”~ configuration.

* Booting Up
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Booting-Up
:END:

Let's decide on where we want to setup our declarations for personalising Emacs
to our needs. Then, let's bootstrap Emacs' primitive packaging mechanism with a
slick interface ---which not only installs Emacs packages but also programs at
the operating system level, all from inside Emacs!  Finally, let's declare who
we are and use that to setup Emacs email service.

** =~/.emacs= vs. =init.org=

/Emacs is extenible/: When Emacs is started, it tried to load a user's Lisp
program known as a initialisation file which specfies how Emacs should look and
behave for you.  Emacs looks for the init file using the filenames =~/.emacs.el,
~/.emacs,= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el= ---it looks for the first one that exists, in
that order; at least it does so on my machine.  Below we'll avoid any confusion
by /ensuring/ that only one of them is in our system.  Regardless, execute =C-h o
user-init-file= to see the name of the init file loaded. Having no init file is
tantamount to have an empty init file.

+ One can read about the various Emacs initialisation files [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File][online]] or
  within Emacs by the sequence ~C-h i m emacs RET i init file RET~.
+ A /friendly/ tutorial on ‘beginning a =.emacs= file’ can be read
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Beginning-init-File.html#Beginning-init-File][online]] or within Emacs by ~C-h i m emacs lisp intro RET i .emacs RET~.
+ After inserting some lisp code and saving, such as ~(set-background-color
  "salmon")~, one can load the changes with ~M-x eval-buffer~.
+ In a terminal, use ~emacs -Q~ to open emacs without any initialisation files.

# Emacs is a stateful Lisp-based machine!

Besides writing Lisp in an init file, one may use Emacs' customisation
interface, ~M-x customize~: Point and click to change Emacs to your needs. The
resulting customisations are, by default, automatically thrown into your init
file ---=~/.emacs= is created for you if you have no init file.  This interface is
great for beginners, but one major drawback is that it's a bit difficult to
share settings since it's not amicable to copy-pasting.
#
# Unless suggested otherwise, Emacs writes stuff to =~.emacs= automatically.

We shall use =~/.emacs.d/init.el= as the initialisation file so that /all/ of our
Emacs related files live in the /same/ directory: =~/.emacs.d/=.

A raw code file is difficult to maintain, especially for a /large/ system such as
Emacs. Instead, we're going with a ‘literate programming’ approach: The
intialisation configuration is presented in an essay fromat, along with headings
and subheadings, intended for consumption by humans such as myself, that,
incidentally, can be ‘tangled’ into a raw code file that is comprehensible by a
machine. We achieve this goal using [[#Life-within-Org-mode][org-mode]] ---/Emacs' killer app/--- which is
discussed in great detail later on.

*** /Adventure time!/ “Honey, where's my init?”

Let's use the three possible locations for the initialisation files
to explore how Emacs finds them. Make the following three files.

_~/.emacs.el_
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Emacs looks for this first;
(set-background-color "chocolate3")
(message-box ".emacs.el says hello")
#+END_SRC
_~/.emacs_
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; else; looks for this one;
(set-background-color "plum4")
(message-box ".emacs says hello")
#+END_SRC
_~/.emacs.d/init.el_
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Finally, if neither are found; it looks for this one.
(set-background-color "salmon")
(message-box ".emacs.d/init.el says hello")
#+END_SRC

Now restart your Emacs to see how there super tiny initilaisation files
affect your editor. Delete some of these files in-order for others to take effect!

*** /Adventure time!/ Using Emacs' Easy Customisation Interface

We have chosen not to keep configurations in ~~/.emacs~ since
Emacs may explicitly add, or alter, code in it.

Let's see this in action!

Execute the following to see additions to the ~~/.emacs~ have been added by
‘custom’.
 1. =M-x customize-variable RET line-number-mode RET=
 2. Then press: ~toggle~, ~state~, then ~1~.
 3. Now take a look: =C-x C-f ~/.emacs=

*** Support for ‘Custom’

Let the Emacs customisation GUI insert configurations into its own file, not
touching or altering my initialisation file.  For example, I tend to have local
variables to produce ~README.org~'s and other matters, so Emacs' Custom utility
will remember to not prompt me each time for the safety of such local variables.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
(load custom-file)
#+end_src

Speaking of local variables, let's always ones we've already marked as safe
---see the bottom of the source of this file for an example of local variables.
( At one point, all my files had locals! )
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq enable-local-variables :safe)
#+END_SRC

** =use-package= ---The start of =init.el=

There are a few ways to install packages ---run ~C-h C-e~ for a short overview.
The easiest, for a beginner, is to use the command ~package-list-packages~ then
find the desired package, press ~i~ to mark it for installation, then install all
marked packages by pressing ~x~.

+ /Interactively/:  ~M-x list-packages~ to see all melpa packages that can install
  - Not in alphabetical order, so maybe search with ~C-s~.
  - Press ~Enter~ on a package to see its description.
+ Or more quickly, to install, say, the haskell mode: ~M-x package-install RET
  unicode-fonts RET~.

“From rags to riches”: Recently I switched to Mac ---first time trying the OS.
I had to do a few ~package-install~'s and it was annoying.  I'm looking for the
best way to package my Emacs installation ---including my installed packages and
configuration--- so that I can quickly install it anywhere, say if I go to
another machine.  It seems ~use-package~ allows me to configure and auto install
packages.  On a new machine, when I clone my ~.emacs.d~ and start Emacs, on the
first start it should automatically install and compile all of my packages
through ~use-package~ when it detects they're missing.

First we load ~package~, the built-in package manager.  It is by default only
connected to the GNU ELPA (Emacs Lisp Package Archive) repository, so we
extended it with other popular repositories; such as the much larger [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]
(Milkypostman's ELPA) ---it builds packages [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][directly from the source-code
reposistories of developers]], rather than having all packages in one repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Make all commands of the “package” module present.
(require 'package)

;; Internet repositories for new packages.
(setq package-archives '(("org"       . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                         ("gnu"       . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa"     . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))

;; Actually get “package” to work.
(package-initialize)
(package-refresh-contents)
#+END_SRC

- All installed packages are placed, by default, in =~/.emacs.d/elpa=.
- *Neato:* /If one module requires others to run, they will be installed automatically./

:Faq:
If there are issues with loading the archives, say, "Failed to download ‘gnu’
archive."  then ensure you can both read and write, recursively, to your
.emacs.d/ E.g., within emacs try to execute (package-refresh-contents) and
you'll observe a permissions error.
:End:

The declarative configuration tool [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/][use-package]] is a
macro/interface that manages other packages and the way they interact.
+ It allows us to tersely organise a package's configuration.
  - By default, ~(use-package foo)~ only loads a package, if it's on our system.
    * Use the standalone keyword ~:disabled~ to turn off loading
      a module that, say, you're not using anymore.
+ It is /not/ a package manger, but we can make it one by having it automatically
  install modules, via Emacs packing mechanism, when they're not in our system.

  We achieve this by using the keyword option ~:ensure t~.
+ Here are common keywords we will use, in super simplified terms.
  - ~:init   f₁ … fₙ~  /Always/ executes code forms ~fᵢ~ /before/ loading a package.
  - ~:diminish str~  Uses /optional/ string ~str~ in the modeline to indicate
                   this module is active. Things we use often needn't take
                   real-estate down there and so no we provide no ~str~.
  - ~:config f₁ … fₙ~ /Only/ executes code forms ~fᵢ~ /after/ loading a package.

    The remaining keywords only take affect /after/ a module loads.

  - ~:bind ((k₁ . f₁) … (kₙ . fₙ)~ Lets us bind keys ~kᵢ~, such as
    ~"M-s o"~, to functions, such as =occur=.
    * When /n = 1/, the extra outer parenthesis are not necessary.
  - ~:hook ((m₁ … mₙ) . f)~ Enables functionality ~f~ whenever we're in one of the
    modes ~mᵢ~, such as ~org-mode~. The ~. f~, along with the outermost parenthesis,
    is optional and defaults to the name of the package ---Warning: Erroneous
    behaviour happens if the package's name is not a function provided by the
    package; a common case is when package's name does /not/ end in ~-mode~,
    leading to the invocation ~((m₁ … mₙ) . <whatever-the-name-is>-mode)~ instead.
    # More generally, it let's us hook functions fᵢ, which may depend on the
    # current mode, to modules mᵢ.
    Additionally, when /n = 1/, the extra outer parenthesis are not necessary.
  - ~:custom (k₁ v₁ d₁) … (kₙ vₙ dₙ)~ Sets a package's custom variables ~kᵢ~ to have
    values ~vᵢ~, along with /optional/ user documentation ~dᵢ~ to explain to yourself,
    in the future, why you've made this decision.

    This is essentially ~setq~ within ~:config~.

We now bootstrap ~use-package~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

We can now invoke ~(use-package XYZ :ensure t)~ which should check for the ~XYZ~
package and make sure it is accessible.  If not, the ~:ensure t~ part tells
~use-package~ to download it ---using the built-in ~package~ manager--- and place it
somewhere accessible, in =~/.emacs.d/elpa/= by default.  By default we would like
to download packages, since I do not plan on installing them manually by
downloading Lisp files and placing them in the correct places on my system.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src
The use of ~:ensure t~ only installs absent modules, but it does no updating.
Let's set up [[https://github.com/rranelli/auto-package-update.el][an auto-update mechanism]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package auto-package-update
  :config
  ;; Delete residual old versions
  (setq auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t)
  ;; Do not bother me when updates have taken place.
  (setq auto-package-update-hide-results t)
  ;; Update installed packages at startup if there is an update pending.
  (auto-package-update-maybe))
#+END_SRC

Here's another example use of ~use-package~.  Later on, I have a “show recent files
pop-up” command set to ~C-x C-r~; but what if I forget? This mode shows me all key
completions when I type ~C-x~, for example.  Moreover, I will be shown other
commands I did not know about! Neato :-)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Making it easier to discover Emacs key presses.
(use-package which-key
  :diminish
  :config (which-key-mode)
          (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)
          (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.05))
#+END_SRC
⟨ Honestly, I seldom even acknowledge this pop-up; but it's always nice to show
to people when I'm promoting Emacs. ⟩

Above, the ~:diminish~ keyword indicates that we do not want the mode's name to be
shown to us in the modeline ---the area near the bottom of Emacs.  It does so by
using the ~diminish~ package, so let's install that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package diminish
  :config ;; Let's hide some markers.
    (diminish 'eldoc-mode)
    (diminish 'org-indent-mode)
    (diminish 'subword-mode))
#+end_src

Here are other packages that I want to be installed onto my machine.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Efficient version control.
(use-package magit
  :config (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status))

(use-package htmlize)
;; Main use: Org produced htmls are coloured.
;; Can be used to export a file into a coloured html.

;; Quick BibTeX references, sometimes.
(use-package biblio)

;; Get org-headers to look pretty! E.g., * → ⊙, ** ↦ ◯, *** ↦ ★
;; https://github.com/emacsorphanage/org-bullets
(use-package org-bullets
  :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))

;; Haskell's cool
(use-package haskell-mode)

;; Lisp libraries with Haskell-like naming.
(use-package dash)    ;; “A modern list library for Emacs”
(use-package s   )    ;; “The long lost Emacs string manipulation library”.

;; Library for working with system files;
;; e.g., f-delete, f-mkdir, f-move, f-exists?, f-hidden?
(use-package f)
#+END_SRC

Note:
+ [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]]: “A modern list library for Emacs”
  - E.g., ~(--filter (> it 10) (list 8 9 10 11 12))~

  - E.g., ~s-trim, s-replace, s-join~.

** ~README~ ---From ~init.org~ to ~init.el~

Rather than manually extracting the Lisp code from this literate document each
time we alter it, let's instead add a ‘hook’ ---a method that is invoked on a
particular event, in this case when we save the file.  More precisely, in this
case, ~C-x C-s~ is a normal save whereas ~C-u C-x C-s~ is a save after forming
~init.elc~ and ~README.md~.

Alternatively, evaluate the above source block with ~C-c C-c~ to produce a ~README~

Notes:
+ Github supports several markup languages, one of which is Org-mode.
  - It seems that Github uses [[https://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby][org-ruby]] to convert org-mode to html.
  - [[https://github.com/novoid/github-orgmode-tests][Here]] is a repo demonstrating how Github interprets Org-mode files.
  - org-ruby supports inline ~#+HTML~ but [[https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby/issues/51][not html blocks]].

+ It seems coloured HTML does not render well:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(org-html-export-to-html)
(shell-command "mv README.html README.md")
#+END_SRC
+ [[https://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html][JavaScript supported display of web pages]] with:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle no
#+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:t buttons:t
#+END_SRC
  This looks nice for standalone pages, but doesn't incorporate nicely with
  github README.org.

The above mentioned package ~toc-org~, which creates an up-to-date table
of contents in an org file, at any heading tagged ~:TOC:~.  It's useful
primarily for README files on Github.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package toc-org
  ;; Automatically update toc when saving an Org file.
  :hook (org-mode . toc-org-mode))

;; Make toc-org links appear to be the same as their visible text.
(defun toc-org-hrefify-org (str &optional hash)
  "Given a heading, transform it into a href using the org-mode rules."
  (toc-org-format-visible-link str))
#+END_SRC

I'm not sure how I feel about actually having the Github-serving TOC in my
source file. It's nice to have around, from an essay-perspecive, but it breaks
HTML export since its links are /not/ well-behaved; e.g., ~:ignore:~-ed headlines
appear in the toc, but do not link to any visible heading in the HTML; likewise,
headings with URLS in their names break. As such, below I've developed a way to
erase it altogether ---alternatively, one could mark the toc as ~:noexport:~, but
this would then, in my current approach, not result in a toc in the resulting
README.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Installing Emacs packages directly from source

[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][Quelpa]] allows us to build Emacs packages directly from source repositories.  It
derives its name from the German word /Quelle/, for /souce/ [code], adjoined to
ELPA.  Its ~use-package~ interface allows us to use ~use-package~ like normal but
when we want to install a file from souce we use the keyword ~:quelpa t~.


# Example invocation.
# (quelpa '(discover-my-major :fetcher git :url "https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/discover-my-major.git"))
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package quelpa-use-package)
#+END_SRC

Let's use this to obtain an improved info-mode from the EmacsWiki.

** =magit= ---Emacs' porcelain interface to git
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ~magit~---Emacs'-porcelain-interface-to-git
:END:

Let's setup an Emacs ‘porcelain’ interface to git ---it makes working with
version control tremendously convenient.  Moreover, I add a little pop-up so
that I don't forget to commit often!

Why use ~magit~ as the interface to the git version control system?  In ~magit~
buffer nearly everything can be acted upon: Press =return=, or =space=, to see
details and =tab= to see children items, usually.

First, let's setup our git credentials.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; See here for a short & useful tutorial:
;; https://alvinalexander.com/git/git-show-change-username-email-address
(when (equal ""
(shell-command-to-string "git config user.name"))
  (shell-command "git config --global user.name \"Musa Al-hassy\"")
  (shell-command "git config --global user.email \"alhassy@gmail.com\""))
#+END_SRC

Below is my personal quick guide to working with magit ---for a full tutorial
see [[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2012/12/driving-git-with-emacs-pure-magic-with.html.html][jr0cket's blog]].

+ ~dired~ :: See the contents of a particular directory.

+ ~magit-init~ :: Put a project under version control.
  The mini-buffer will prompt you for the top level folder version.
  A ~.git~ folder will be created there.

+ ~magit-status~ , ~C-x g~ :: See status in another buffer.
   Press ~?~ to see options, including:
  - g :: Refresh the status buffer.
     # The status buffer may be refereshed using ~g~, and all magit buffers by ~G~.
  - TAB ::  See collapsed items, such as what text has been changed.
  - ~q~ :: Quit magit, or go to previous magit screen.
  - ~s~ :: Stage, i.e., add, a file to version control.
         Add all untracked files by selecting the /Untracked files/ title.

    [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/119807/185815][The staging area is akin to a pet store; commiting is taking the pet home.]]

  - ~k~ :: Kill, i.e., delete a file locally.
  - ~K~ :: This' ~(magit-file-untrack)~ which does ~git rm --cached~.
  - ~i~ :: Add a file to the project ~.gitignore~ file. Nice stuff =)
  - ~u~ :: Unstage a specfif staged change highlighed by cursor.
           ~C-u s~ stages everything --tracked or not.
  - ~c~ :: Commit a change.
    * A new buffer for the commit message appears, you write it then
      commit with ~C-c C-c~ or otherwise cancel with ~C-c C-k~.
      These commands are mentioned to you in the minibuffer when you go to commit.
    * You can provide a commit to /each/ altered chunk of text!
      This is super neat, you make a series of local such commits rather
      than one nebulous global commit for the file. The ~magit~ interface
      makes this far more accessible than a standard terminal approach!
    * You can look at the unstaged changes, select a /region/, using ~C-SPC~ as usual,
      and commit only that if you want!
    * When looking over a commit, ~M-p/n~ to efficiently go to previous or next altered sections.
    * Amend a commit by pressing ~a~ on ~HEAD~.

  - ~d~ :: Show differences, another ~d~ or another option.
    - This is magit! Each hunk can be acted upon; e.g., ~s~ or ~c~ or ~k~ ;-)
  - ~v~ :: Revert a commit.
  - ~x~ :: Undo last commit. Tantamount to ~git reset HEAD~~ when cursor is on most recent
           commit; otherwise resets to whatever commit is under the cursor.
  - ~l~ :: Show the log, another ~l~ for current branch; other options will be displayed.
    - Here ~space~ shows details in another buffer while cursour remains in current
      buffer and, moreover, continuing to press ~space~ scrolls through the other buffer!
      Neato.
  - ~P~ :: Push.
  - ~F~ :: Pull.
  - ~:~ :: Execute a raw git command; e.g., enter ~whatchanged~.

Notice that every time you press one of these commands, a ‘pop-up’ of realted
git options appears! Thus not only is there no need to memorise many of them,
but this approach makes /discovering/ other commands easier.

historic versions of a file. The following utility allows us to ~M-x

arbitrary historic versions, or quit.
- If we want to roll back to a previous version, we just ~write-file~ or ~C-x C-s~
  as usual! The power of text!

** Installing OS packages from within Emacs ---Amethyst!

Sometimes Emacs packages depend on existing system binaries, ~use-package~ let's
us ensure these exist using the ~:ensure-system-package~ keyword extension.

- This is like ~:ensure t~ but operates at the OS level and uses your default
  OS package manager.

Let's obtain the extension.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Auto installing OS system packages
(use-package use-package-ensure-system-package)
#+END_SRC
Here's an example use:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(shell-command-to-string "type rg") ;; ⇒ rg not found
(use-package rg
  :ensure-system-package rg) ;; ⇒ There's a buffer *system-packages*
                             ;;   installing this tool at the OS level!
#+END_SRC
If you look at the ~*Messages*~ buffer, via ~C-h e~, on my machine it says
~brew install rg: finished~ ---it uses ~brew~ which is my OS package manager!

+ The [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#use-package-ensure-system-package][use-package-ensure-system-package]] documentation for a flurry of use cases.

The extension makes use of [[https://gitlab.com/jabranham/system-packages][system-packages]]; see its documentation to learn
more about managing installed OS packages from within Emacs. This is itself
a powerful tool, however it's interface ~M-x system-packages-install~ leaves much
to be desired ---namely, tab-compleition listing all available packages,
seeing their descriptions, and visiting their webpages.
This is remedied by [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages][M-x helm-system-packages]] then ~RET~ to see a system
package's description, or ~TAB~ for the other features!
/This is so cool!/

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; An Emacs-based interface to the package manager of your operating system.
(use-package helm-system-packages)
#+END_SRC

The Helm counterpart is great for /discovarability/, whereas
the plain ~system-packages~ is great for /programmability/.

It is tedious to arrange my program windows manually, and as such I love tiling
window managers, which automatically arrange them.  I had been using [[https://xmonad.org][xmonad]]
until recently when I obtained a Mac machine and now use [[https://ianyh.com/amethyst/][Amethyst]] ---“Tiling
window manager for macOS along the lines of xmonad.”

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Unlike the Helm variant, we need to specify our OS pacman.
(setq system-packages-package-manager 'brew)
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Use “brew cask install” instead of “brew install” for installing programs.
(setf (nth 2 (assoc 'brew system-packages-supported-package-managers))

;; If the given system package doesn't exist; install it.

** Who am I? ---Using Gnus for Gmail
Let's set the following personal Emacs-wide variables ---to be used in other

By default, in Emacs, we may send mail: Write it in Emacs with ~C-x m~,
then press ~C-c C-c~ to have it sent via your OS's default mailing system
---mine appears to be Gmail via the browser. Or cancel sending mail with
~C-c C-k~ ---the same commands for org-capturing, discussed below (•̀ᴗ•́)و

To send and read email in Emacs we use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnus][GNUS]], which, like GNU itself, is a
recursive acronym: GNUS Network User Service.

  1. Execute, rather place in your init:
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     #+end_src
     Revert to the default OS mailing method by setting this variable to
     ~mailclient-send-it~.

  2. Follow only the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail#toc1][quickstart here]]; namely, make a file named ~~/.gnus~ containing:
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.gnus
     ;; user-full-name and user-mail-address should be defined

(setq gnus-select-method
      '(nnimap "gmail"

     You need generate a password for your application only (Gnus, in this case).

See https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en

I finished setup for Gnus in 1 minute, even though I never use 2 step verification for Gmail before.

Enable 2 step verification, I did a quick search and went to https://myaccount.google.com/security. Just follow its step by step guide and submit the form

In order to setup Gmail app password, I googled the keyword and went to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en. Click the link "How to generate an App password", read the guide and click the link inside it. Login in with your google account

There is a "App" section inside dashboard, you can not miss it. Follow the guide.

I don't know what's your Gnus setup. To be honest, your question lacks the essential information. See https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/gnus-guide-en.org on how to setup Gnus.
:End:

  4. You will then obtain a secret password, the ~x~ marks below, which you insert
     in a file named ~~/.authinfo~ as follows ---using your email address.
     #+begin_src shell :tangle no
     machine imap.gmail.com login alhassy@gmail.com password xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx port imaps
     machine smtp.gmail.com login alhassy@gmail.com password xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx port 587
     #+end_src

  5. In Emacs, ~M-x gnus~ to see what's there.

     Or compose mail with ~C-x m~ then send it with ~C-c C-c~.
     - Press ~C-h m~ to learn more about message mode for mail composition; or
       read the [[https://www.gnus.org/manual/message.pdf][Message Manual]].

In gnus, by default items you've looked at disappear ---i.e., are archived.
They can still be viewed in, say, your online browser if you like.
In the ~Group~ view, ~R~ resets gnus, possibly retriving mail or alterations
from other mail clients. ~q~ exits gnus in ~Group~ mode, ~q~ exits the particular
view to go back to summary mode. Only after pressing ~q~ from within a group
do changes take effect on articles ---such as moves, reads, deletes, etc.

  + RET :: Open an article.

  + B m :: Move an article, in its current state, to another group ---i.e.,
    ‘label’ using Gmail parlance.

    Something to consider doing when finished with an article.

    To delete an article, simply move it to ‘trash’ ---of course this will delete it
    in other mail clients as well. There is no return from trash.

    Emails can always be archieved ---never delete, maybe?

  + ! :: Mark an article as read, but to be kept around ---e.g., you have not
    replied to it, or it requires more reading at a later time.

  + R :: Reply to email with sender's content there in place.
    - ~r~ to reply to an email with sender's content in adjacent buffer.

  + d ::  Mark an article as done, i.e., read it and it can be archived.

** Hydra: Supply a prefix only once
Sometimes we have keybindings that share a common prefix, say ~C-c j~ and ~C-c k~,
and we invoke them in an arbitrary sequence, it would be nice to invoke the
shared prefix /only once/ thereby having:
| ~C-c j C-c j C-c k C-c k M-3 C-c j M-5 C-c k~ | ≈ | ~C-c jjkk3j5k~ |

- The [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra#the-one-with-the-least-amount-of-code][“hydra-zoom”]] example from the documentation really showcases this utility.
- After the prefix is supplied, all extensions are shown in a minibuffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Invoke all possible key extensions having a common prefix by
;; supplying the prefix only once.
(use-package hydra)

;; The standard syntax:
;; (defhydra hydra-example (global-map "C-c v") ;; Prefix
;;   ;; List of triples (extension method description) )
#+END_SRC

From the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] repository is a ‘description for poets’:
#+begin_quote
Once you summon the Hydra through the prefixed binding (the body + any one
head), all heads can be called in succession with only a short extension.

The Hydra is vanquished once Hercules, any binding that isn't the Hydra's head,
arrives. Note that Hercules, besides vanquishing the Hydra, will still serve his
original purpose, calling his proper command. This makes the Hydra very
seamless, it's like a minor mode that disables itself auto-magically.
#+end_quote

See [[Taking a tour of one's edits]] below for a small and useful example.

:END:

/Pop up a terminal, do some work, then close it using the same command./

[[https://github.com/kyagi/shell-pop-el][Shell-pop]] uses only one key action to work: If the buffer exists, and we're in
it, then hide it; else jump to it; otherwise create it if it doesn't exit.  Use
universal arguments, e.g., ~C-u 5 C-t~, to have multiple shells and the same
universal arguments to pop those shells up, but ~C-t~ to pop them away.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package shell-pop
  :custom
    ;; This binding toggles popping up a shell, or moving cursour to the shell pop-up.
    (shell-pop-universal-key "C-t")

    ;; Percentage for shell-buffer window size.
    (shell-pop-window-size 30)

    ;; Position of the popped buffer: top, bottom, left, right, full.
    (shell-pop-window-position "bottom")

    ;; Please use an awesome shell.
    (shell-pop-term-shell "/bin/zsh"))
#+END_SRC
# There are also a number of hooks for shell-pop. E.g., to unconditionally kill the buffer afterwards.

Now that we have access to quick pop-up for a shell, let's get a pretty and
practical shell: [[https://www.howtogeek.com/362409/what-is-zsh-and-why-should-you-use-it-instead-of-bash/][zsh]] along with the [[https://ohmyz.sh/][Oh My Zsh]] community configurations give us:

1. ~brew install zsh~
2. ~sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"~

   This installs everything ^_^

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Be default, Emacs please use zsh
;; E.g., M-x shell
(setq shell-file-name "/bin/zsh")
#+END_SRC

Out of the box, zsh comes with
+ git support; the left side indicates which branch we're on and
  whether the repo is dirty, ✗.
+ Recursive path expansion; e.g., ~/u/lo/b TAB~ expands to ~/usr/local/bin/~
+ Over [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins#apache2-macports][250+ Plugins]] and [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes][125+ Themes]] that are enabled by simply
  mentioning their name in the ~.zshrc~ file.

The defaults have been good enough for me, for now ---as all else is achieved
via Emacs ;-)

** Automatic Backups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Backups
:END:
By default, Emacs saves backup files ---those ending in =~=--- in the current
directory, thereby cluttering it up. Let's place them in ~~/.emacs.d/backups~, in
case we need to look for a backup; moreover, let's keep old versions since
there's disk space to go around ---what am I going to do with 500gigs when nearly
all my ‘software’ is textfiles interpreted within Emacs 😼

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; New location for backups.
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups")))

;; Silently delete execess backup versions
(setq delete-old-versions t)

;; Only keep the last 1000 backups of a file.
(setq kept-old-versions 1000)

;; Even version controlled files get to be backed up.
(setq vc-make-backup-files t)

;; Use version numbers for backup files.
(setq version-control t)
#+END_SRC

Why backups? Sometimes I may forget to submit a file, or edit, to my
version control system, and it'd be nice to be able to see a local
automatic backup. Whenever ‘I need space,’ then I simply empty
the backup directory, if ever. That the backups are numbered is so sweet ^_^

Like package installations, my backups are not kept in any version control
system, like git; only locally.

Let's use an elementary diff system for backups.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package backup-walker
  :commands backup-walker-start)
#+END_SRC

In a buffer that corresponds to a file, invoke ~backup-walker-start~
to see a visual diff of changes /between/ versions.
By default, you see the changes ‘backwards’: Red means
delete these things to get to the older version; i.e.,
the red ‘-’ are newer items.

To create backups explicitly use save-buffer (C-x C-s) with prefix arguments.

diff-backup and dired-diff-backup compares a file with its backup or vice versa. But there is no function to restore backup files.

Emacs only makes a backup the very first time a buffer is saved; I'd prefer
Emacs makes backups everytime I save! ---If I saved, that means I'm at an
important checkpoint, so please check what I have so far as a backup!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Make Emacs backup everytime I save

(defun my/force-backup-of-buffer ()
  "Lie to Emacs, telling it the curent buffer has yet to be backed up."
  (setq buffer-backed-up nil))

(add-hook 'before-save-hook  'my/force-backup-of-buffer)
#+END_SRC
# See the name of the latest backup, which is appeneded by a number for each save ;-)
# (file-newest-backup "~/.emacs.d/init.org")

It is intestesting to note that the above snippet could be modified to [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/6918217/3550444][make our
own backup system]], were Emacs lacked one, by having our function simply save
copies of our file ---on each save--- where the filename is augmented with a
timestamp.

** “Being at the Helm” ---Completion Framework

Whenever we're have a choice to make from a list, [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][Helm]] provides possible
completions.  This is extremely helpful for when switching between buffers, =C-x
b=, and discovering & learning about other commands!  E.g., press ~M-x~ to see
recently executed commands and other possible commands!

/Try and be grateful!/
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm
 :diminish
 :init (helm-mode t)
 :bind (("M-x"     . helm-M-x)
        ("C-x C-f" . helm-find-files)
        ("C-x b"   . helm-mini)     ;; See buffers & recent files; more useful.
        ("C-x r b" . helm-filtered-bookmarks)
        ("C-x C-r" . helm-recentf)  ;; Search for recently edited files
        ("C-c i"   . helm-imenu)
        ("C-h a"   . helm-apropos)
        ;; Look at what was cut recently & paste it in.
        ("M-y" . helm-show-kill-ring)

        :map helm-map
        ;; We can list ‘actions’ on the currently selected item by C-z.
        ("C-z" . helm-select-action)
        ;; Let's keep tab-completetion anyhow.
        ("TAB"   . helm-execute-persistent-action)
        ("<tab>" . helm-execute-persistent-action)))
#+END_SRC

Helm provides generic functions for completions to replace
tab-completion in Emacs with no loss of functionality.

+ The =execute-extended-command=, the default “M-x”, is replaced with ~helm-M-x~
  which shows possible command completions.

  Likewise with ~apropos~, which is helpful for looking up commands.
  It shows all meaningful Lisp symbols whose names match a given pattern.

+ The ‘Helm-mini’, ~C-x b~, shows all buffers, recently opened files,
  bookmarks, and allows us to create new bookmarks and buffers!

+ The ‘Helm-imenu’, ~C-c i~, yields a a menu of all “top-level items” in a file;
  e.g., functions and constants in source code or headers in an org-mode file.

  ⟳ Nifty way to familarise yourself with a new code base, or one from a while
  ago.

+ When Helm is active, ~C-x~ lists possible course of actions on the currently
  selected item.

When ~helm-mode~ is enabled, even help commands make use of it.
E.g., ~C-h o~ runs ~describe-symbol~ for the symbol at point,
and ~C-h w~ runs ~where-is~ to find the key binding of the symbol at point.
Both show a pop-up of other possible commands.

Let's ensure ~C-x b~ shows us: Current buffers, recent files, and bookmarks
---as well as the ability to create bookmarks, which is via ~C-x r b~ manually.
For example, I press ~C-x b~ then type any string and will have the option of
making that a bookmark referring to the current location I'm working in, or
jump to it if it's an existing bookmark, or make a buffer with that name,
or find a file with that name.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-mini-default-sources '(helm-source-buffers-list

                                    helm-source-bookmark-set
                                    helm-source-buffer-not-found))
#+END_SRC

Incidentally, Helm even provides an [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html#orgheadline24][interface]] for the ~top~ program via
~helm-top~. It also serves as an interface to popular search engines
and over 100 websites such as ~google, stackoverflow, ctan~, and ~arxiv~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(system-packages-ensure "surfraw")

If we want to perform a google search, with interactive suggestions,
then invoke ~helm-google-suggest~ ---which can be acted for other serves,
such as Wikipedia or Youtube by ~C-z~. For more google specific options,
there is the ~google-this~ package.

Let's switch to a powerful searching mechanism -- [[https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop][helm-swoop]].  It allows us to
not only search the current buffer but also the other buffers and to make live
edits by pressing ~C-c C-e~ when a search buffer exists. Incidentally, executing
~C-s~ on a word, region, will search for that particular word, region; then make
changes with ~C-c C-e~ and apply them by ~C-x C-s~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-swoop

          ("C-S-s" . 'helm-swoop-back-to-last-point))
  :custom (helm-swoop-speed-or-color nil "Give up colour for speed.")
          (helm-swoop-split-with-multiple-windows nil "Do not split window inside the current window."))
#+END_SRC

:ThisBecomeMoreAnnoyingThanUseful:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no

              helm-swoop-pattern ;; this variable keeps the last used words
            $pre-input))))

#+END_SRC

Press ~M-i~ after a search has executed to enable it for all buffers.

We can also limit our search to org files, or buffers of the same mode,
or buffers belonging to the same project!

Note that on the Mac, I can still perform default Emacs search using
/Cmd+f/.

Emacs' default theme leaves much to be desired:

The ‘modeline’ is a part near the bottom of Emacs that gives information about

Other separators ---of modeline information--- that I've considered include

For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(blue (purple (forest (green (yellow (blue))))))
#+end_src

There is a powerful package called ‘smartparens’ for working with pair-able
characters, but I've found it to be too much for my uses. Instead I'll utilise
the lightweight package ~electric~, which Emacs provides out of the box.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(electric-pair-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
It supports, by default, ACSII pairs ~{}, [], ()~ and Unicode ~‘’, “”, ⟪⟫, ⟨⟩~.

When writing Lisp, it is annoyong to have ‘<’ and ‘>’ be completed
/and/ considered as pairs.  Let's disassociate them from both notions.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; The ‘<’ and ‘>’ are not ‘parenthesis’, so give them no compleition.
(setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate
      (lambda (c)
        (or (member c '(?< ?> ?~)) (electric-pair-default-inhibit c))))

;; Treat ‘<’ and ‘>’ as if they were words, instead of ‘parenthesis’.
(modify-syntax-entry ?< "w<")
(modify-syntax-entry ?> "w>")
#+END_SRC

:Rainbow_delims:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Act as usual unless a ‘<’ or ‘>’ is encountered.
;; ( char-at is really “character at poisition”; C-h o! )
(setq rainbow-delimiters-pick-face-function
      (lambda (depth match loc)
        (unless (member (char-after loc) '(?< ?>))
          (rainbow-delimiters-default-pick-face depth match loc))))
#+END_SRC

*Adding Org-emphasise markers for pair completion ---Disabled.*

Let's add the org-emphasises markers: If we select a word then press =*=, it
becomes bold; likewise for ~/~ for emphasise.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq electric-pair-pairs
         '((?~ . ?~)
           (?* . ?*)
           (?/ . ?/)))

;; Let's also, for example, avoid obtaining double ‘~’ and ‘/’ when searching for a file.

;; Disable pairs when entering minibuffer
(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda () (electric-pair-mode 0)))

;; Renable pairs when existing minibuffer
(add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook (lambda () (electric-pair-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

I use ‘~’ and ‘/’ too much during file navigation, and ‘*’ when marking numerous
Org headers, for which the ‘completed closing pair’ must tiresomely be deleted.
** Neotree: Directory Tree Listing

#+END_SRC
By default ~C-x d~ invokes ~dired~, but I prefer ~neotree~ for file
management.

  ⟨ Edit: As a naive user, this is what I thought; yet a year later,
                  I've almost never used neotree. ⟩

Useful navigational commands include
+ ~U~ to go up a directory.
+ ~C-c C-c~ to change directory focus; ~C-C c~ to type the directory out.
+ ~?~ or ~h~ to get help and ~q~ to quit.

As always, to go to the neotree pane when it's the only other window,
execute ~C-x o~.

I /rarely/ make use of this feature; company mode & Helm together quickly provide
an automatic replacement for nearly all of my uses.

Let's load the following package, which automatically resizes windows so that
the window containing the cursor is the largest, according to the golden ratio.
Consequently, the window we're working with is nice and large yet the other windows
are still readable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package golden-ratio

After some time this got a bit annoying and I'm no longer  using this.

** Persistent Scratch Buffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Persistent-Scratch-Buffer
:END:

The ~*scratch*~ buffer is a nice playground for temporary data or experiments.

However, by default its contents are not saved --which may be an issue if we
have not relocated our playthings to their appropriate files. Whence let's save
& restore the scratch buffer by default.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package persistent-scratch
  ;; Enable both autosave and restore the last saved state of scratch
  ;; buffer, if any, on Emacs start.
  :config (persistent-scratch-setup-default))
#+END_SRC

We might accidentally close this buffer, so we could utilise the following.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun scratch ()
   "Recreate the scratch buffer, loading any persistent state."
   (interactive)
   (switch-to-buffer-other-window (get-buffer-create "*scratch*"))
   (insert initial-scratch-message)
   (ignore-errors (persistent-scratch-restore))
   (persistent-scratch-autosave-mode 1)
   (org-mode)
   (local-set-key (kbd "C-x C-s") 'persistent-scratch-save))

;; This doubles as a quick way to avoid the common formula: C-x b RET *scratch*
#+END_SRC

I use Org-mode often, so that's how I want things to appear.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq initial-scratch-message (concat
  "#+Title: Persistent Scratch Buffer"
  "\n#\n# Welcome! This’ a place for trying things out."

* Prose
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Prose
:END:

Emacs can be setup with a spellchecker and other expected features of a word processing tool
---however these features apply Emacs-wide since nearly everything is
essentially text (•̀ᴗ•́)و

Let's start off by cleaning-up any accidental trailing whitespace and in other
places upon save.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

** Fill-mode ---Word Wrapping
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Fill-mode----Word-Wrapping
:END:
In fill mode, when you type past the end of a line, Emacs automatically starts a
new line, cleverly formatting paragraphs. This is a powerful form of “word
wrap”.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Let's avoid going over 80 columns
(setq fill-column 80)

;; Wrap long lines when editing text
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+END_SRC

We may press ~M-q~ to cleverly redistribute the line breaks within any paragraph,
thereby making it look better. With a prefix argument, it justifies it as well
---i.e., pads extra white space to make the paragraph appear rectangular.

            Note that ~M-o M-s~ centres a line of text ;-) Fun stuff!

** Word Completion
Let's enable [[https://company-mode.github.io/][“complete anything” mode]] ---it ought to start in half a second and
only need two characters to get going, which means word suggestions are provided
and so I need only type partial words then tab to get the full word!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company
  :diminish
  :config
  (global-company-mode 1)
  (setq ;; Only 2 letters required for completion to activate.
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2

        ;; Search other buffers for compleition candidates
        company-dabbrev-other-buffers t
        company-dabbrev-code-other-buffers t

        ;; Allow (lengthy) numbers to be eligible for completion.
        company-complete-number t

        ;; M-⟪num⟫ to select an option according to its number.
        company-show-numbers t

        ;; Do not downcase completions by default.
        company-dabbrev-downcase nil

        ;; Even if I write something with the ‘wrong’ case,
        ;; provide the ‘correct’ casing.
        company-dabbrev-ignore-case t

        ;; Immediately activate completion.
        company-idle-delay 0))

;; It's so fast that we don't need a key-binding!
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") 'company-complete)
#+end_src
Note that ~M-/~ goes through a sequence of completions.  Besides the
arrow keys, we can also use ~C-~ or ~M-~ with ~n, p~ to navigate the options. Note
that [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/360][by default]] company mode does not support completion for phrases containing
hyphens ---this can be altered, if desired.

Besides boring word completion, let's add support for [[https://github.com/dunn/company-emoji][emojis]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company-emoji
  :config (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-emoji))
#+end_src

For example: 🥞 💻 🐵 ✉️😉 🐬 🌵.

➡️On a new line, write ~:~ then any letter to have a tool-tip appear.
All emoji names are lowercase. ◀

The libraries ~emojify~ and ~emojify-logos~ provides cool items like =:haskell: :emacs:
:org: :ruby: :python:=.
Unfortunately they do not easily export to html with org-mode, so I'm not using them.
:Alternatives:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package emojify
 :config (setq emojify-display-style 'image)
 :init (global-emojify-mode 1)) ;; Will install missing images, if need be.
#+END_SRC

(use-package emojify-logos
:after emojify)

For example,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
 :emacs: :haskell: :org: :c: :wink: :ruby: :python: :c: :html5:
#+end_src
Yields :emacs: :haskell: :org: :c: :wink: :ruby: :python: :c: :html5:. Run ~(emojify-insert-emoji)~ to see more.

Rather than remember all of these, let's install [[https://github.com/syohex/emacs-ac-emoji][ac-emoji]]
for completion of emoji names.

(use-package ac-emoji
  :init (ac-emoji-setup)
)
:End:

Now we can run ~langtool-check~ on the subsequent grammatically incorrect

when we click on them we get the reason why; then we may invoke
~langtool-correct-buffer~ to quickly use the suggestions to fix each correction,
and finally invoke ~langtool-check-done~ to stop any remaining red colouring.

Inspired by Matt Might's [[http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/][3 shell scripts to improve your writing, or
"My Ph.D. advisor rewrote himself in bash"]], this Emacs interface
emphasises, via underline, the following weaknesses in writing ---so
that I can fix them or decide that they are appropriate for the
scenario.

Sentences that cut out the following problems may become stronger
---by being more terse or precise.

+ Weasel Words ::
  Phrases that sound good without conveying information;
  such as vague precision or subjective phrases.

  E.g., /a number of, surprisingly, very close/.

  It's okay not to have exact details, but rather than “I don't know”
  explain why not and what the next steps will be.

+ Passive Voice ::
  Phrases wherein interest is in the object experiencing an action,
  rather than the subject that performs the action.

  - Bad: The house /was built by/ my father.
  - Good: My father /built/ this house.

  Likewise, including relevant or explanatory information as in “X
  guarantees Y” is an improvement over “Y is guaranteed”.

  Sometimes the subject really is irrelevant, such as
  “We did X” whereas “X happened” suffices.

  👍 If the relevant subject is unclear and, also, the text reads
  better in the active, then change a phrase.

+ Duplicated Words :: Occurrences of, say, “the the”.

   Harder to catch manually, but easier mechanically ;-)

** Placeholder Text ---For Learning & Experimenting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Placeholder-Text----For-Learning---Experimenting
:END:

When learning about Emacs formatting commands, such as zap-to-char ~M-z~
or transpose ~M-t~, it's best to have filler text ---even better when
it's automatically generated instead of typing it out ourselves. The
following will give us a series of commands ~lorem-ipsum-insert-⋯~ for
inserting lists, sentences, paragraphs and using a prefix argument,
with ~C-u~, we can request to generate any number of them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

‘Lorem’ is not a word itself, but it comes from the Latin ‘Dolorem Ipsum’
which means “pain in and of itself”.

See this [[https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Emacs Cheat Sheet]] to try out the textual navigation and formatting
bindings on lorem ipsum, gibberish text.

[[https://mazzo.li/posts/AgdaSort.html][Agda]] is one of my favourite languages, it's like Haskell on steroids.  Let's set
it up for the main sake of its Unicode input ---you may do likewise using TeX
input.  ( [[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/][The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively

Executing ~agda-mode setup~ appends the following text to the ~.emacs~ file.

Wolfram Kahl has recommended the following settings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;(setq agda2-program-args (quote ("RTS" "-M4G" "-H4G" "-A128M" "-RTS")))

These arguments specify

| ~-M[size]~   | Maximum heap size                                    |
| ~-H[size]~   | Suggested heap size                                  |
| ~-A[size]~   | Allocation area size used by the garbage collector   |

Full documentation for the ~ghc~ runtime argumentscan be found [[https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/runtime-control.html][here]].

Additional arguments that may be useful include
| ~-S[file]~ | Produces information about “each and every garbage collection” |
|          | - Outputs to ~stderr~ by default                               |

** ~M-n,p~: Word-at-Point Navigation

Let's mimic the ~C-n,p~ constructs from line to word, so that unoccupied ~M-n,p~ now
serve to take us to the next or previous instance of the word under the
cursor. This is less intrusive than searching ~C-s~ or listing all occurrences ~M-s

Unfortunately, as it currently is, there is no universal argument support:
~C-u 2 M-p~ does /not/ take you to the second previous instance of a word
---the prefix is instead ignored.

The default symbol replacement is [[https://github.com/mickeynp/smart-scan/issues/23][over-zealous]] in that it replaces sub-terms
occurring as parts of larger words. Let's do something about that.

Let's obtain Org-mode along with the extras that allow us to ignore
heading names, but still utilise their contents ---e.g., such as a heading
named ‘preamble’ that contains org-mode setup for a file.

(use-package org
  :ensure org-plus-contrib
  :config
  (require 'ox-extra)

#+end_src

~org-plus-contrib~ contain the files that are included with Emacs plus all
  contributions from the [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/src/master/contrib][org-mode repoistory]].
+ Use the ~:ignore:~ tag on headlines you'd like to have ignored, while not
  ignoring their content.
+ Use the ~:noexport:~ tag to omit a headline /and/ its contents.

Let's enable the [[http://notesyoujustmightwanttosave.blogspot.com/2011/12/org-speed-keys.html][Org Speed Keys]] so that when the cursor is at the beginning of
a headline, we can perform fast manipulation & navigation using the standard Emacs movement
controls, such as:
+ ~#~ toggle ~COMMENT~-ing for an org-header.
+ ~s~ toggles “narrowing” to a subtree; i.e., hide the rest of the document.

  If you narrow to a subtree then any export, ~C-c C-e~, will only consider
  the narrowed detail.

+ ~I/O~ clock In/Out to the task defined by the current heading.
   - Keep track of your work times!
   - ~v~ view agenda.
+ ~u~ for jumping upwards to the parent heading.
+ ~c~ for cycling structure below current heading, or ~C~ for cycling global structure.
+ ~i~ insert a new same-level heading below current heading.
+ ~w~ refile current heading; options list pops-up to select which heading to move it to. Neato!
+ ~t~ cycle through the available TODO states.
+ ~^~ sort children of current subtree; brings up a list of sorting options.
+ ~n/p~ for next/previous /visible/ heading.
+ ~f/b~ for jumping forward/backward to the next/previous /same-level/ heading.
+ ~D/U~ move a heading down/up.
+ ~L/R~ recursively promote (move leftwards) or demote (more rightwards) a heading.
+ ~1,2,3~ to mark a heading with priority, highest to lowest.

We can add our own speed keys by altering the ~org-speed-commands-user~
association list variable.

#  To see the commands available, execute  ~M-x org-speed-command-help~.

** COMMENT Using org-mode as a Day Planner
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Using-org-mode-as-a-Day-Planner
:END:

- Rescheduled from "[2011-07-24 Sun]" on [2019-09-20 Fri 15:09]
⟪ This section is based on a dated, yet delightful, tutorial
  of the same title by [[http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/][John Wiegley]]. ⟫

We want a day-planner with the following use:
0. “Mindlessly” & rapidly create new tasks.
1. Schedule and archive tasks at the end, or start, of the work day.
2. Glance at a week's tasks, shuffle if need be.
3. Prioritise the day's tasks. Aim for ≤15 tasks.
4. Progress towards ~A~ tasks completion by documenting work completed.
5. Repeat! During the day, if anything comes up, capture it and intentionally
   forget about it.

[[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Setting-up-capture][Capture]] lets me quickly make notes & capture ideas, with associated reference material,
without any interruption to the current work flow. Without losing focus on what you're doing,
quickly jot down a note of something important that just came up.

E.g., I have a task, or something I wish to note down, rather than opening
some file, then making a heading, then writing it; instead, I press
~C-c c t~ and a pop-up appears, I make my note, and it disappears with my
notes file(s) now being altered! Moreover, by default it provide a timestamp
and a link to the file location where I made the note --helpful for tasks, tickets,
to be tackled later on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-default-notes-file "~/Dropbox/todo.org")
(define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
#+end_src

By default we only get a ‘tasks’ form of capture, let's add some more.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(cl-defun my/make/org-capture-template
   (shortcut heading &optional (no-todo nil) (description heading) (category heading) (scheduled t))
  "Quickly produce an org-capture-template.

  After adding the result of this function to ‘org-capture-templates’,
  we will be able perform a capture with “C-c c ‘shortcut’”
  which will have description ‘description’.
  It will be added to the tasks file under heading ‘heading’
  and be marked with category  ‘category’.

  ‘no-todo’ omits the ‘TODO’ tag from the resulting item; e.g.,
  when it's merely an interesting note that needn't be acted upon.
  ─Probably a bad idea─

  Defaults for ‘description’ and ‘category’ are set to the same as
  the ‘heading’. Default for ‘no-todo’ is ‘nil’.

  Scheduled items appear in the agenda; true by default all items are.

  The target is ‘file+headline’ and the type is ‘entry’; to see
  other possibilities invoke: C-h o RET org-capture-templates.
  The “%?” indicates the location of the Cursor, in the template,
  when forming the entry.
  "
  `(,shortcut ,description entry
      (file+headline org-default-notes-file
         ,(concat heading "\n#+CATEGORY: " category))
         , (concat "*" (unless no-todo " TODO") " %?\n"
                (when nil ;; this turned out to be a teribble idea.
                  ":PROPERTIES:\n:"
                (if scheduled
                    "SCHEDULED: %^{Any time ≈ no time! Please schedule this task!}t"
                  "CREATED: %U")
                "\n:END:") "\n\n ")
      :empty-lines 1 :time-prompt t))

;; For now, let's automatically schedule items a week in advance.
;; TODO: FIXME: This overwrites any scheduling I may have performed.
(defun my/org-capture-schedule ()
  (org-schedule nil "+7d"))

(add-hook 'org-capture-before-finalize-hook 'my/org-capture-schedule)

(setq org-capture-templates
  `(
     ,(my/make/org-capture-template "t" "Tasks, Getting Things Done")
     ,(my/make/org-capture-template "r" "Research")
     ,(my/make/org-capture-template "m" "Email")

     ,(my/make/org-capture-template "a" "Arbitrary Reading and Learning")
     ,(my/make/org-capture-template "p" "Personal Matters")))
#+end_src

For now I capture everything into a single file.
One would ideally keep separate client, project, information in its own org file.
The ~#+CATEGORY~ appears alongside each task in the agenda view --keep reading.

Looking at ~my/make/org-capture-template~, one notices that capture actually
lets you add /any/ type of item to /any/ file.

Let's also ensure TODO-s respect hierarchical structure.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Cannot mark an item DONE if it has a  TODO child.
;; Conversely, all children must be DONE in-order for a parent to be DONE.
(setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
#+END_SRC

*Where am I currently capturing?*
+ During meetings, when a nifty idea pops into my mind, I quickly capture it.
  - I've found taking my laptop to meetings makes me an active listener
    and I get much more out of my meetings since I'm taking notes.
+ Through out the day, as I browse the web, read, and work; random ideas pop-up, and I capture them indiscriminately.
+ I envision that for a phone call, I would open up a capture to make note of what the call entailed so I can review it later.
+ Anywhere you simply want to make a note, for the current heading, just press
  ~C-c C-z~. The notes are just your remarks along with a timestamp; they are
  collected at the top of the tree, under the heading.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Ensure notes are stored at the top of a tree.
  (setq org-reverse-note-order nil)
  #+end_src

Anyhow…

Step 1: When new tasks come up
Isn't it great that we can squirrel away info into some default location
then immediately return to what we were doing before --with speed & minimal distraction! ♥‿♥
Indeed, if our system for task management were slow then we may not produce tasks and so forget them altogether! щ(゜ロ゜щ)
+ Entering tasks is a desirably impulsive act;
   do not make any further scheduling considerations.

   The next step, the review stage occurring at the end or the start of
   the workday, is for processing.

#+begin_quote
/The reason for this is that entering new tasks should be impulsive, not reasoned.//
/Your reasoning skills are required for the task at hand, not every new tidbit.//
/You may even find that during the few hours that transpire between creating a/
/task and categorizing it, you’ve either already done it or discovered it doesn’t/
/need to be done at all!/ -- [[http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/][John Wiegley]]
#+end_quote

When my computer isn't handy, make a note on my phone then transfer it later.

*Step 2: Filing your tasks*
At a later time, a time of reflection, we go to our tasks list and actually schedule time to get them done
by ~C-c C-s~ then pick a date by entering a number in the form ~+n~ to mean that task is due ~n~ days from now.
+ Tasks with no due date are ones that “could happen anytime”, most likely no time at all.
+ At least schedule tasks reasonably far off in the future, then reassess when the time comes.
+ An uncompleted task is by default rescheduled to the current day, each day, along with how overdue it is.
  - Aim to consciously reschedule such tasks!

  With time, it will become clear what is an unreasonable day
  verses what is an achievable day.

Let's keep track of how many times, and when, we have pushed events to other dates.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Add a note whenever a task's deadline or scheduled date is changed.
(setq org-log-redeadline 'time)
(setq org-log-reschedule 'time)
#+END_SRC

*Step 3: Quickly review the upcoming week*
The next day we begin our work, we press ~C-c a a~ to see the
scheduled tasks for this week --~C-c C-s~ to re-schedule the
task under the cursor and ~r~ to refresh the agenda.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key global-map "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
#+end_src

*Step 4: Getting ready for the day*
After having seen our tasks for the week, we press ~d~ to enter daily view
for the current day. Now we decide whether the items for today are
~A~: of high urgency & important; ~B~: of moderate urgency & importance; or
~C~: Pretty much optional, or very quick or fun to do.
+ ~A~ tasks should be both important /and/ urgently done on the day they were scheduled.
  - Such tasks should be relatively rare!
  - If you have too many, you're anxious about priorities and rendering
    priorities useless.
+ ~C~ tasks can always be scheduled for another day without much worry.
  - Act! If the thought of rescheduling causes you to worry, upgrade it to a
    ~B~ or ~A~.
+ As such, most tasks will generally be priority ~B~:
  Tasks that need to be done, but the exact day isn't as critical as with an
  ~A~ task. These are the “bread and butter” tasks that make up your day to day
  life.

On a task item, press ~,~ then one of ~A, B, C~ to set its priority.
Then ~r~ to refresh.

*Step 5: Doing the work*
Since ~A~ tasks are the important and urgent ones, if you do all of the ~A~ tasks and
nothing else today, no one would suffer. It's a good day (─‿‿─).

There should be no scheduling nor prioritising at this stage.
You should not be touching your tasks file until your next review session:
Either at the end of the day or the start of the next.

+ Leverage priorities! E.g., When a full day has several ~C~ tasks, reschedule
  them for later in the week without a second thought.
  - You've already provided consideration when assigning priorities.

*Step 6: Moving a task toward completion*
My workflow states are described in the section
[[Workflow States]] and contain states: ~TODO, STARTED, WAITING, ON_HOLD, CANCELLED, DONE~.
+ Tasks marked ~WAITING~ are ones for which we are awaiting some event, like someone
  to reply to our query. As such, these tasks can be rescheduled until I give up
  or the awaited event happens --in which case I go to ~STARTED~ and document
  the reply to my query.
+ The task may be put off indefinitely with ~ON_HOLD~, or I may choose never to do it
  with ~CANCELLED~. Along with ~DONE~, these three mark a task as completed
  and so it needn't appear in any agenda view.

I personally clock-in and clock-out of tasks --keep reading--,
where upon clocking-out I'm prompted for a note about what I've accomplished
so far.
Entering a comment about what I've done, even if it's very little,
feels like I'm getting something done. It's an explicit marker of progress.

In the past, I would make a “captain's log” at the end of the day, but that's
like commenting code after it's written, I didn't always feel like doing it and
it wasn't that important after the fact. The continuous approach of noting after
every clock-out is much more practical, for me at least.

*Step 7: Archiving Tasks*
During the review state,
when a task is completed, ‘archive’ it with ~C-c C-x C-s~: This marks it as done, adds a time stamp,
and moves it to a local ~*.org_archive~ file. This was our ‘to do’ list becomes a ‘ta da’ list showcasing
all we have done (•̀ᴗ•́)و

Archiving keeps task lists clutter free, but unlike deletion it allows
us, possibly rarely, to look up details of a task or what tasks were completed
in a certain time frame --which may be a motivational act, to see that you have
actually completed more than you thought, provided you make and archive tasks
regularly. We can use ~(org-search-view)~ to search an org file /and/ the
archive file too, if we enable it so.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; C-c a s ➩ Search feature also looks into archived files.
;; Helpful when need to dig stuff up from the past.
(setq org-agenda-text-search-extra-files '(agenda-archives))
#+END_SRC

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Invoking the agenda command shows the agenda and enables
;; the org-agenda variables.
(org-agenda "a" "a")
#+end_src

Let's install some helpful views for our agenda.
+ ~C-c a c~: See completed tasks at the end of the day and archive them.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Pressing ‘c’ in the org-agenda view shows all completed tasks,
;; which should be archived.
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
  '("c" todo "DONE|ON_HOLD|CANCELLED" nil))
#+end_src
+ ~C-c a u~: See unscheduled, undeadlined, and undated tasks in my todo files.
  Which should then be scheduled or archived.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
  '("u" alltodo ""
     ((org-agenda-skip-function
        (lambda ()

              (org-agenda-overriding-header "Unscheduled TODO entries: "))))
#+end_src

** COMMENT Journaling
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Journaling
:END:

Thus far I've made it easy to quickly capture ideas and tasks,
not so much on the analysis phase:

- What was accomplished today?
- What are some notably bad habits? Good habits?
- What are some future steps?

Rather than overloading the capture mechanism for such thoughts,
let's employ ~org-journal~ --journal entries are stored in files such as
~journal/20190407~, where the file name is simply the date, or only one
file per year as I've set it up below.
Each entry is the week day, along with the date,
then each child tree is an actual entry with a personal
title preceded by the time the entry was made.
Unlike capture and its agenda support, journal ensures entries are maintained in
chronological order with calendar support.

Since org files are plain text files, an entry can
be written anywhere and later ported to the journal.

The separation of concerns is to emphasise the capture stage
as being quick and relatively mindless, whereas the Journaling
stage as being mindful.
Even though we may utilise capture to provide quick support for including
journal entries, I have set my journal to be on a yearly basis --one file per year--
since I want to be able to look at previous entries when making the current entry;
after all, it's hard to compare and contrast easily unless there's multiple entries
opened already.

As such, ideally at the end of the day, I can review what
has happened, and what has not, and why this is the case,
and what I intend to do about it, and what problems were encountered
and how they were solved --in case the problem is encountered again in the future.
*Consequently, if I encounter previously confronted situations, problems,*
*all I have to do is reread my journal to get an idea of how to progress.*
Read more about [[https://www.google.com/search?q=on+the+importance+of+reviwing+your+day+daily&oq=on+the+importance+of+reviwing+your+day+daily&aqs=chrome..69i57.367j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8][the importance of reviewing your day on a daily basis]].

Moreover, by journaling with Org on a daily basis, it can be
relatively easy to produce a report on what has been happening
recently, at work for example. For now, there is no need to
have multiple journals, for work and for personal life, as
such I will utilise the tag ~:work:~ for non-personal matters.

Anyhow, the setup:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-journal
  ; :bind (("C-c j" . org-journal-new-entry))
  :config
  (setq org-journal-dir "~/Dropbox/journal/"
        org-journal-file-type 'yearly
        org-journal-file-format "Personal-%Y-%m-%d")
)

(defun my/org-journal-new-entry (prefix)
  " Open today’s journal file and start a new entry.

    With a prefix, we use the work journal; otherwise the personal journal.
  "
  (interactive "P")
  (if prefix
      (let ((org-journal-file-format "Work-%Y-%m-%d"))
        (org-journal-new-entry nil))
    (org-journal-new-entry nil))
  (org-mode) (org-show-all))

;; C-u C-c j ⇒ Work journal ;; C-c C-j ⇒ Personal journal
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j") 'my/org-journal-new-entry)
#+end_src

Bindings available in ~org-journal-mode~, when journaling:
+ ~C-c C-j~: Insert a new entry into the current journal file.
   - Note keys for ~org-journal-new-entry~ overwrite those for ~org-goto~.
+ ~C-c C-s~: Search the journal for a string.
  - Note keys for ~org-journal-search~ overwrite those for ~org-schedule~.

# C-c C-f - go to the next journal file.
# C-c C-b - go to the previous journal file.

All journal entries are registered in the Emacs Calendar.
To see available journal entries do ~M-x calendar~.
Bindings available in the calendar-mode:

+ ~j~: View an entry in a new buffer.
     # C-j - view an entry but do not switch to it.
+ ~i j~: add a new entry into the day’s file
+ ~f w/m/y/f/F~: Search in all entries of the current week, month, year, all of time,
  of in all entries in the future.
#
# [ - go to previous day with journal entries.
# ] - go to next day with journal entries.

# Some key-bindings in org-journal overwrite org-mode key bindings
# Major modes are supposed to only use key bindings of the form C-c C-?, where ? can be any letter. With org-mode already using most interesting keys, collisions are inevitable. Currently, org-journal overwrites
#
# C-c C-f (org-forward-heading-same-level) with org-journal-open-next-entry
# C-c C-b (org-backward-heading-same-level) with org-journal-open-previous-entry

** COMMENT Workflow States
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: WorkflowStates
:END:

Here are some of my common workflow states, ---the ‘X/Y’ indicates to do action ‘X’
when entering a state and ‘Y’ when leaving it, with ‘!’ denoting a timestamp
should be generated and ‘@’ denoting a user note should be made.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      (quote ((sequence "TODO(t)" "STARTED(s@/!)" "|" "DONE(d/!)")
              (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "ON_HOLD(h@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)"))))

;; Since DONE is a terminal state, it has no exit-action.
;; Let's explicitly indicate time should be noted.
(setq org-log-done 'time)
#+end_src

The ~@~ brings up a pop-up to make a local note about why the state changed.
*Super cool stuff!*
In particular, we transition from ~TODO~ to ~STARTED~ once 15 minutes, or a
reasonable amount, of work has transpired.
Since all but one state are marked for logging, we could use the
~lognotestate~ logging facility of org-mode, which prompts for a note
every time a task’s state is changed.

Entering a comment about what I've done, even if it's very little,
feels like I'm getting something done. It's an explicit marker of progress
and motivates me to want to change my task's states more often until I see
it marked ~DONE~.

Here's how they are coloured,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      (quote (("TODO" :foreground "red" :weight bold)
              ("STARTED" :foreground "blue" :weight bold)
              ("DONE" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
              ("WAITING" :foreground "orange" :weight bold)
              ("ON_HOLD" :foreground "magenta" :weight bold)
              ("CANCELLED" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold))))
#+end_src

Now we press ~C-c C-t~ then the letter shortcut to actually make the state of an org heading.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)
#+end_src

We can also change through states using Shift- left, or right.
# (setq org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change nil)

Let's draw a state diagram to show what such a workflow looks like.

[[http://plantuml.com/index][PlantUML]] supports drawing diagrams in a tremendously simple format
--it even supports Graphviz/DOT directly and many other formats.
Super simple setup instructions can be found [[http://eschulte.github.io/babel-dev/DONE-integrate-plantuml-support.html][here]]; below are a bit more

Of note:
+ Multiline comments are with ~/' comment here '/~, single quote starts a one-line comment.
+ Nodes don't need to be declared, and their names may contain spaces if they are enclosed in double-quotes.
+ One forms an arrow between two nodes by writing a line with ~x ->[label here] y~
  or ~y <- x~; or using ~-->~ and ~<--~ for dashed lines. The label is optional.

  To enforce a particular layout, use ~-X->~ where ~X ∈ {up, down, right, left}~.

+ To declare that a node ~x~ has fields ~d, f~ we make two new lines having
  ~x : f~ and ~x : d~.
+ One adds a note by a node ~x~ as follows: ~note right of x: words then newline\nthen more words~.
  Likewise for notes on the ~left, top, bottom~.
  # - A note can be on several lines. It's terminated by ~end note~.
 + Interesting sprites and many other things can be done with PlantUML. Read the docs.

This particular workflow is inspired by [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Bernt Hansen]]

** Clocking Work Time
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Clocking-Work-Time
:END:

Let's keep track of the time we spend working on tasks that we may have captured for ourselves the previous day.
Such statistics provides a good idea of how long it actually takes me to accomplish a certain task in the future
and it lets me know where my time has gone.

+ Clock in :: on a heading with ~I~, or in the subtree with ~C-c C-x C-i~.
+ Clock out :: of a heading with ~O~, or in the subtree with ~C-c C-x C-o~.
+ Clock report :: See clocked times with ~C-c C-x C-r~.

After clocking out, the start and end times, as well as the elapsed time, are added to a drawer
to the heading. We can punch in and out of tasks as many times as desired, say we took a break or
switched to another task, and they will all be recorded into the drawer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Record a note on what was accomplished when clocking out of an item.
(setq org-log-note-clock-out t)
#+end_src

To get started, we could estimate how long a task will take and clock-in;
then clock-out and see how long it actually took.

# To review the day’s accomplishments, type ‘l’
# (org-agenda-log-mode) from the agenda view.

Moreover, we can overlay due dates and priorities to tasks in a non-intrusive way that is
easy to edit by hand.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; List of all the files & directories where todo items can be found. Only one for now.
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/todo.org"))

;; How many days ahead the default agenda view should look
(setq org-agenda-ndays 7)

;; How many days early a deadline item will begin showing up in your agenda list.
(setq org-deadline-warning-days 14)

;; In the agenda view, days that have no associated tasks will still have a line showing the date.
(setq org-agenda-show-all-dates t)

(setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)

;; Scheduled items marked as complete will not show up in your agenda view.
(setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)

;; The agenda view – even in the 7-days-at-a-time view – will always begin on the current day.
;; This is important, since while using org-mode as a day planner, you never want to think of
;; days gone past. That’s something you do in other ways, such as when reviewing completed tasks.
(setq org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil)
#+end_src

Sometimes, at the beginning at least, I would accidentally invoke the transposed
command ~C-x C-c~, which saves all buffers and quits Emacs. So here's a helpful
way to ensure I don't quit Emacs accidentally.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Resume clocking task when emacs is restarted

;; Show lot of clocking history
(setq org-clock-history-length 23)

;; Resume clocking task on clock-in if the clock is open
(setq org-clock-in-resume t)

;; Sometimes I change tasks I'm clocking quickly - this removes clocked tasks with 0:00 duration
(setq org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks t)

;; Clock out when moving task to a done state
(setq org-clock-out-when-done t)

;; Save the running clock and all clock history when exiting Emacs, load it on startup
(setq org-clock-persist t)

;; Do not prompt to resume an active clock
;; (setq org-clock-persist-query-resume nil)

;; Include current clocking task in clock reports
(setq org-clock-report-include-clocking-task t)
#+end_src

*Finding tasks to clock in*
Use one of the following options, with the top-most being the first to be tried.
+ From anywhere, ~C-u C-c C-x C-i~ yields a pop-up for recently clocked in tasks.
+ Pick something off today's agenda scheduled items.
+ Pick a ~Started~ task from the agenda view, work on this unfinished task.
+ Pick something from the ~TODO~ tasks list in the agenda view.

# Reporting activities
# C-c C-x i

+ ~C-c C-x C-d~ also provides a quick summary of clocked time for the current org file.

*Estimates versus actual time*
Before clocking into a task, add to the properties drawer ~:Effort: 1:25~ or ~C-c C-x C-e~, for a task
that you estimate will take an hour an twenty-five minutes, for example. Now the modeline
will have will mention the time elapsed alongside the task name.
+ This is also useful when you simply want to put a time limit on a task that wont be
  completed anytime soon, say writing a thesis or a long article, but you still want
  to work on it for an hour a day and be warned when you exceed such a time constraint.

  :Not_working_for_me:
  Even if you switch tasks then clock into this task again, the alarm will ring
  again, nagging you to actual listen to yourself and work on other matters.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-clock-sound "~/.emacs.d/school-bell.wav")
#+end_src
   :end:

  When you've gone above your estimate time, the modeline shows it to be red.

Upon HTML export, each tree heading is assigned an ID to be used for hyperlinks.
Default IDs are something like ~org1957a9d~, which does not endure the test of time:
Re-export will produce a different id. Here's a rough snippet to generate
IDs from headings, by replacing spaces with hyphens, for headings without IDs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun my/ensure-headline-ids (&rest _)
  "Org trees without a :CUSTOM_ID: property have the property set to be their heading. All non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with ‘-’.

   If multiple trees end-up with the same id property, issue a message and undo
   any property insertion thus far.
  "
  (interactive)
  (let ((ids))
    (org-map-entries
     (lambda ()
       (org-with-point-at (point)
         (let ((id (org-entry-get nil "CUSTOM_ID")))
           (unless id
             (setq id (s-replace-regexp "[^[:alnum:]]" "-" (nth 4 (org-heading-components))))
             (if (not (member id ids))
                 (push id ids)
               (message-box "Oh no, a repeated id!\n\n\t%s" id)
               (undo)
               (setq quit-flag t))
             (org-entry-put nil "CUSTOM_ID" id))))))))

(advice-add 'org-html-export-to-html :before 'my/ensure-headline-ids)

#+END_SRC

One may then use ~[[#my-custom-id]]~ to link to the entry with ~CUSTOM_ID~ property
~my-custom-id~.

Interestingly, ~org-set-property~, ~C-c C-x p~, lets us insert a property from
a selection of available ones, then we'll be prompted for a value for it
from a list of values you've used elsewhere. This is useful for remaining
consistent for when trees share similar properties.

    succeeding source blocks now inherit this name and so are tangled
    to the same module file. How? By placing the following line at the top

   If no name is provided for the ‘target’ file that is generated from the

   Note that this only loads the blocks tangled to ‘target’.

   For example, file ‘X.org’ may have haskell blocks that tangle to files
   ‘X.hs’, ‘Y.hs’ and ‘Z.hs’. If no target name is supplied, we tangle all blocks
   but only load ‘X.hs’ into the ghci buffer. A helpful technique to load the
   last, bottom most, defined haskell module, is to have the module declaration's
   source block be ‘:tangle (setq CODE “Y.hs”)’, for example; then the following
   code blocks will inherit this location provided our Org file has at the top
   ‘#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle (current-module))’.
   Finally, our ‘compile-command’ suffices to be ‘(my/org-run-haskell CODE)’.

Org-mode can export tables as TAB or comma delimited formats. I set the default format to CSV with:

(setq org-table-export-default-format "orgtbl-to-csv")
Exporting to CSV format is the only one I use and this provides the default so I can just hit RETURN when prompted for the format.

To export the following table I put the cursor inside the table and hit M-x org-table-export which prompts for a filename and the format which defaults to orgtbl-to-csv from the setting above.

   ⇨ Pretty docstrings, with links and highlighting.

I like [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]] and wanted it to have the same behaviour as ~C-h o~, which
~helpful-at-point~ does not achieve. The incantation above makes ~C-h o~ use ~helpful~
in that if the cursor is on a symbol, then it is offered to the user as a
default search item for help, otherwise a plain search box for help
appears. Using a universal argument lets us drop to the built-in help command.

** Coding with a Fruit Salad: Semantic Highlighting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Coding-with-a-Fruit-Salad--Semantic-Highlighting
:END:

+ /Syntax/ highlighting ⇨ Specific words are highlighted in strong colours so that
    the /structure/ can be easily gleaned.
  - Generally this only includes a language's keywords, such as ~if, loop, begin, end , cond~.
  - User defined names generally share one colour; usually black.
  - Hence, an ~if~ block may be seen as one coloured keyword followed by
    a blob of black text.

  /Obvious keywords are highlighted while the rest remains in black!/

+ /Semantic/ highlighting ⇨ Identifiers obtain unique colouring.
  - This makes it much easier to visually spot dependencies with a quick glance.
    + One can *see* how data flows through a function.
  - In dynamic languages, this is a visual form of typing: Different colours are
    for different names.
    + Especially helpful for (library) names that are almost the same.
    + This can be accomplished anywhere in Emacs by pressing ~M-s h .~ on
      a selected phrase.

+ Here are some reads:
  - [[https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e][Coding in color: How to make syntax highlighting more useful]] ---an excellent, terse, read
  - [[https://zwabel.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/c-ide-evolution-from-syntax-highlighting-to-semantic-highlighting/][C++ IDE Evolution: From Syntax Highlighting to Semantic Highlighting]]
    + Names with a similar prefix share a colour, and class-local items share a colour.
  - [[https://wordsandbuttons.online/lexical_differential_highlighting_instead_of_syntax_highlighting.html][Lexical differential highlighting instead of syntax highlighting]]
    + /Ideally, the smaller the lexical difference, the greater the color difference should be./
  - [[https://github.com/jacksonrayhamilton/context-coloring][Colouring by Context]] ---an Emacs package
  - [[http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/][A case against syntax highlighting]]


For Emacs, [[https://github.com/ankurdave/color-identifiers-mode][Color Identifiers Mode]] gives unique highlighting to identifiers.
- It comes with support for a bunch of languages, and one can add support for others.
- It picks colours adaptively to fit the theme; one uses ~M-x color-identifiers:regenerate-colors~ after a theme change.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package color-identifiers-mode)
(global-color-identifiers-mode)
#+END_SRC

When writing a new name, after about ~5 seconds it obtains a colour which is then
propagated immediately to any new occurrences. This timeout before recolouring
is to avoid any lag from multithreading and can be changed by altering the following
line (#64) in the source file, changing the ~5~ to a smaller number.

** TODO COMMENT Snippets -- Template Expansion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: COMMENT-Snippets----Template-Expansion
:END:

It is common that there is a sequence of text that we tend to repeat
often, possibly with a name or some other parameter altered.
Such a snippet could be written once then provided by a simple
Lisp insert command with the parameters being queried. Luckily, others
have written such pleasant utilities.

[[http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-development.html][Yasnippet]] is a pleasant utility for template expansion with the alluring
feature to allow arbitrary Lisp code to be executed during expansion.
The declaration of templates is verbose, requiring a particular file
hierarchy, as such I utilise [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad][Yankpad]] which allows me to employ
an Org-mode approach: Each template corresponds to an org heading of
the form ~Key:Words:For:Expansion:Here: name of snippet here~ and the
template body is then the body of the org heading.
Any of ~Key, Words, For, Expansion, Here~ will rewrite into the body
of the org tree. This is much more terse, and I even don't bother
with that; instead preferring to tangle my templates using yankpad
as a mere interface.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Yet another snippet extension program
(use-package yasnippet
  :diminish yas-minor-mode
  :config
    (yas-global-mode 1)
    ;; respect the spacing in my snippet declarations

)

;; Nice “interface” to said program
(use-package yankpad
  ;; :if company-mode ;; load & initialise only if company-mode is defined
  :demand t

    ;; Location of templates

    ;; Load the snippet templates -- useful after yankpad is altered

(defvar company-mode/enable-yas t
  "There can only be one main completition backend, so let's
   enable yasnippet/yankpad as a secondary for all completion backends.")

(defun company-mode/backend-with-yas (backend)
  (if (or (not company-mode/enable-yas)
          (and (listp backend) (member 'company-yankpad backend)))
      backend
    (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend))
            '(:with company-yankpad))))

(setq company-backends (mapcar #'company-mode/backend-with-yas company-backends))
#+end_src

With these settings, along with the ~company~ backend, I may type a keyword
then “tab” it into expansion.

Yankpad requires we have an org file that contains our templates,
so we tangle such a file ~~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org~, and have all of our
templates be globally accessible.
#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle "~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org"  :comments none
,#+Description: This is file is generated from my init.org; do not edit.

,* Default                                           :global:
#+end_src

Here's an example of a common template I perform by hand --no more!
I have the expected habit of copying a URL from someplace then forming
a link to it by writing ~[[URL] [description]]~, since the URL & syntax are already
known, let's expand those and place the cursour at the only unknown --the description.
#+begin_src org :tangle "~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org" :comments none
,** my-org-insert-link: cleverly insert a link copied to clipboard
 [[${1:`(clipboard-yank)`}][$2]] $0
#+end_src

What's going on here?
0. This template is expanded with the keyword ~my-org-insert-link~, then “tab”.
1. The cursour lands at position ~$1~, which has default text being the result
  of evaluating ~(clipboard-yank)~.
  # I've documented this default as being the url.

  # If I leave out the ~$(clipboard-yank)~ part, the default would simply be ~url~.

  We may evaluate Lisp code anywhere by enclosing it in backticks.

  # `(file-name-nondirectory (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name)))`

2. If we're satisfied with the current field, we simply tab to the next field.
   Otherwise, we simply write text --which overwrites the default text.

3. After enough tabbing we complete the template and the cursour lands
   at position ~$0~.

⟪ Having default or mirrored text for ~$2~ would not allow me to see the URL
field, lest I wish to change it or at least confirm it's what I want.
Hence, the ~$2~ field has no default. ⟫

Let's overwrite the usual way to insert such links, via ~C-c C-l~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(cl-defun org-insert-link ()
  "Makes an org link by inserting the URL copied to clipboard
  and prompting for the link description only.

  Type over the shown link to change it, or tab to move to the description
  field.

  This overrides Org-mode's built-in ‘org-insert-link’ utility.
  "
  (interactive)
  (insert "my-org-insert-link")
  (yankpad-expand)
)
#+END_SRC

The [[http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-development.html][Yasnippe manual]] is an accessible read, as is the
 [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad][Yankpad manual]], and showcases many other utilities; such as
having certain snippets being activated enabled only in particular
modes or on demand. Of note is that field ~$n~ can be accessed in
code with the invocation ~(yas-field-value n)~.

The rest of this section is other templates, not much for now,
concluding with actually loading this snippet mechanism globally.

*** Org-mode Templates --A reason I “generate” templates ;)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Org-mode-Templates---A-reason-I-“generate”-templates-;)
:END:

This produces a pop-up list of org-mode block types, if ~src~ is
selected, then a list of my commonly used languages pops-up.
Alternatively, ignore the pop-up menu and write any block or language name.
#+begin_src org :tangle "~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org"  :comments none
,** begin: produce an org-mode block
,#+begin_${1:environment$(let*
    ((block '("src" "example" "quote" "verse" "center" "latex" "html" "ascii"))
     (langs '("c" "emacs-lisp" "lisp" "latex" "python" "sh" "haskell" "plantuml" "prolog"))
     (type (yas-choose-value block)))
     (concat type (when (equal type "src") (concat " " (yas-choose-value langs)))))}
 $0
,#+end_${1:$(car (split-string yas-text))}
#+END_SRC
In this case, ~yas-text~ is equivalent to (~yas-field-value 1)~;
it generally refers to the value of the field being mirrored with ~${n: ⋯yas-text⋯}~.

However, going through pop-ups takes precious time.
Let's introduce a template for my most utilised kind of language blocks.
#+begin_src org :tangle no
,** s-el: Elisp org-block
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
$0
,#+end_src
#+end_src

However, doing this for each language I want is a waste of time
and textual space. Why? The purpose of templates is to reduce repetition,
yet the above block would be repeated with only 3 parts ‘unknown’:
The expansion keyword, the description, and the org-mode source block name.
Whence,
#+name: make-lang-template
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun make-lang-template (key lang)
  "We make an org-mode source block snippet template.

  ‘key’ is the expansion word key for the language ‘lang’;
  the description for the snippet is also ‘lang’.
  "
  (s-join "\n" `(
    ,(concat "** " key ": " lang)
    ,(concat "#+begin_src " lang)
    "$0"
    "#+end_src"
    "\n"
  ))
)
#+end_src

The template /text/ is then generated by the following simple loop
--whose source block is named ~my-org-lang-templates~.
#+NAME: my-org-lang-templates
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :wrap "src org :tangle ~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org" :exports code :results replace drawer
(let (result) ;; ensure result is initially empty
   (dolist (x '( ("s_el" . "emacs-lisp")
                 ("s_org" . "org")
                 ("s_hs" . "haskell")
                 ("s_ag" . "agda2")
                 ("s_c" . "c")
                 ("s_lx" . "latex")
               ) result)
      (setq result (concat result "\n" (make-lang-template (car x) (cdr x))))))
#+end_src

hi
# #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :wrap "src org :tangle ~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org" :exports code :results replace drawer
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :wrap "src org" :results_switches ":tangle nice.txt"
"hello"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src org
hello
#+end_src


The /resulting text/ of this block is tangled to our yankpad; an example of the
resulting text is:
#+begin_example
,** s_el: emacs-lisp
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
$0
,#+end_src
#+end_example


The /resulting text/ of this block, generated below, is tangled to our yankpad
by utilising a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Noweb-reference-syntax.html][noweb]] source block invocation:
#+begin_src org :tangle no
,#+begin_src org :tangle "~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org" :noweb yes
<<my-org-lang-templates()>>
,#+end_src
#+end_src
#+begin_src org  :tangle "~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org" :noweb yes :comments none
<<my-org-lang-templates()>>
#+end_src
#
# The “:eval never-export” means that this block is never tangled on document
# export, C-c C-e.

Now ~s-~, due to company mode, brings up a list of languages
that I can then simply scroll down through, then “enter” upon to
expand. Moreover, the prefix ~s-~ means that the key is mostly irrelevant,
since I needn't remember it because company-mode immediately lists possible completions.
Super neat stuff :-)

Ain't this reminiscent of meta-programming ;-)

⟪ Incidentally, I originally wrote an Elisp script to temporarily
open the yankpad, then append the desired text. However, such
an approach is brittle: I have to manually execute said script.

In contrast, using noweb invocations to tangle the results is
more flexible: Any time the tangling is performed, the yankpad
is kept up to date --no personal intervention from myself.

Observe that noweb could be utilised in a similar fashion to
[[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10603/two-ways-to-share-static-key-pair-values-across-different-tangled-source-files-with-org-mode-literate-programming][share key-value pairs across different source files]].

# Neat, but not what I want.
# https://github.com/abo-abo/auto-yasnippet

:Old_approach:
Now we invoke the following incantation once so that...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(with-temp-buffer

   (find-file "~/.emacs.d/yankpad.org")
   (end-of-buffer)

   (dolist (x '( ("s-el" . "emacs-lisp")
                 ("s-hs" . "haskell")
                 ("s-ag" . "agda2")
                 ("s-c" . "c")
                 ("s-lx" . "latex")
               ))
      (insert (make-lang-template (car x) (cdr x))))

   (save-buffer)
   (kill-buffer)
   (yankpad-reload)
)
#+END_SRC

(yankpad-reload)
:End:

:Fun_albeit_useless_exercise:

Let's push this frontier a bit more …

In expressive languages like Agda, one can not only be type polymorphic
but also ‘level polymorphic’ --since types constitute a hierarchy
where a ‘type’ is uninterestingly an ‘element’ of a higher ‘type’, ad infinitum.
For example, the type of a level polymorphic ′choice’ function would
~{a : Level} (A : Set a) → A~ --note that such a choice function cannot
exist since for any type ~A~ it returns an element of ~A~, then what of the empty
type. Anyhow, the template ~{${1:a} : Level} → (${2:A} : Set $1) → $0~
would suffice to make this happen. Yet, what if we wanted
/n/-many sets?

Make a function that takes /n ≤ 26/ as input, produces a list of
levels, then uses each level to produce a list of type names ;-)

Org-mode settings are, for the most part, in the form ~#+KEYWORD: VALUE~. Of notable interest
are the ~TITLE~ and ~NAME~ keywords. We use the following ~org-keywords~ function to obtain
the values of arbitrary ~#+THIS : THAT~ pairs, which may not necessarily be supported by native
Org-mode --we do so for the case, for example, of the ~CATEGORIES~ and ~IMAGE~ tags associated with an article.

  Details of AlBasmala can be found here:

  Locally: ~/alhassy.github.io/content/AlBasmala.org

  A ‘draft’ will be produced in about ~7 seconds, but does not re-produce
  a PDF and the article has a draft marker near the top. Otherwise,
  it will generally take ~30 seconds due to PDF production, which is normal.
  The default is not a draft and it takes ~20 seconds for the live
  github.io page to update.

  The ‘local’ optiona indicates whether the resulting article should be
  viewed using the local server or the live webpage. Live page is default.

  When ‘draft’ and ‘local’ are both set, the resulting page may momentarily
  show a page-not-found error, simply refresh.

** Elementary Version Control

[[http://www.linfo.org/hard_link.html][Soft links]] are pointers to other filenames, whereas hardlinks
are pointers to memory location of a given filename!
Soft links are preferable since they defer to the orginal filename
and can work across servers.

We can declare them as follows,
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
ln -s source_file myfile
#+END_EXAMPLE

If ~repo~ refers to a directory under version control
--or Dropbox-- we move our init file and emacs directory to it,
then make soft links to these locations so that whenever ~~/.emacs~
is accessed it will refer to ~repo/.emacs~ and likewise for ~.emacs.d~ :-)

On a new machine, copy-paste any existing emacs configs we want
to the ~repo~ folder then ~rm -rf ~~/.emacs*~ and then make the soft
links only.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
repo=~/Dropbox     ## or my git repository: ~/dotfiles

cd ~

mv .emacs $repo/
ln -s $repo/.emacs .emacs

mv .emacs.elc $repo/
ln -s $repo/.emacs.elc .emacs.elc

mv .emacs.d/ $repo/
ln -s $repo/.emacs.d/ .emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note the extra ~/~ after ~.emacs.d~!

You may need to unlink soft links if you already have them;
e.g., ~unlink .emacs.d~.

To make another softlink to a file, say in a blogging directory,
we ~cd~ to the location of interest then execute, say:
~ln -s $repo/.emacs.d/init.org init.org~

While we're at it, let's make this super-duper file (and another) easily
accessible --since we'll be altering it often--:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
cd ~

ln -s dotfiles/.emacs.d/init.org init.org
ln -s alhassy.github.io/content/AlBasmala.org AlBasmala.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

Below I'll equip us with an Emacs ‘porcelain’ interface to git
--it makes working with version control tremendously convenient.
Moreover, I add a little pop-up so that I don't forget to commit often!

Finally, since I've symlinked my ~.emacs~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Don't ask for confirmation when opening symlinked files.

Our ~.emacs~ should be byte-compiled so that when we start Emacs it will
automatically determine if the ~init.org~ file has changed and if so it
would tangle it producing the ~init.el~ file which will then be loaded immediately.

press ~C-ESCAPE-SPACE~, select the region, followed by a pair-able character such as ~[, {, ", ', *,~ etc.
To wrap a single token forwards, use ~C-M-SPACE~.
