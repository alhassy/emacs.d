I enjoy reading others' /literate/ configuration files and
incorporating what I learn into my own. The result is a
sufficiently well-documented and accessible read that yields
a stylish and functional system (•̀ᴗ•́)و

This ~README.org~ has been automatically generated from my
configuration and its contents below are accessible
in (outdated) blog format, with /colour/, or as colourful
PDF, [[https://alhassy.github.io/init/][here]]. Enjoy

Herein I document the configurations I utilise with [[https://gnu.org/s/emacs][Emacs]].

As a [[https://www.offerzen.com/blog/literate-programming-empower-your-writing-with-emacs-org-mode][literate program]] file with [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]], I am ensured optimal navigation
through my ever growing configuration files, ease of usability and reference
for peers, and, most importantly, better maintainability for myself!

Dear reader, when encountering a foregin command ~X~ I encourage you to execute ~(describe-symbol 'X)~, or press ~C-h o~ with the cursor on ~X~.
An elementary Elisp Cheat Sheet can be found [[https://github.com/alhassy/ElispCheatSheet][here]]
and here is a 2-page 3-column [[https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Emacs Cheat Sheet]] of the bindings
in ~“this”~ configuration.

* Booting Up
Let's decide on where we want to setup our declarations for personalising Emacs
to our needs. Then, let's bootstrap Emacs' primitive packaging mechanism with a
slick interface ---which not only installs Emacs packages but also programs at
the operating system level, all from inside Emacs!  Finally, let's declare who
we are and use that to setup Emacs email service.

** =~/.emacs= vs. =init.org=

/Emacs is extenible/: When Emacs is started, it tried to load a user's Lisp
program known as a initialisation file which specfies how Emacs should look and
behave for you.  Emacs looks for the init file using the filenames =~/.emacs.el,
~/.emacs,= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el= ---it looks for the first one that exists, in
that order; at least it does so on my machine.  Below we'll avoid any confusion
by /ensuring/ that only one of them is in our system.  Regardless, execute =C-h o
user-init-file= to see the name of the init file loaded. Having no init file is
tantamount to have an empty init file.

- One can read about the various Emacs initialisation files [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File][online]] or
  within Emacs by the sequence ~C-h i m emacs RET i init file RET~.
- A /friendly/ tutorial on ‘beginning a =.emacs= file’ can be read
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Beginning-init-File.html#Beginning-init-File][online]] or within Emacs by ~C-h i m emacs lisp intro RET i .emacs RET~.
- After inserting some lisp code and saving, such as ~(set-background-color
    "salmon")~, one can load the changes with ~M-x eval-buffer~.
- In a terminal, use ~emacs -Q~ to open emacs without any initialisation files.

Besides writing Lisp in an init file, one may use Emacs' customisation
interface, ~M-x customize~: Point and click to change Emacs to your needs. The
resulting customisations are, by default, automatically thrown into your init
file ---=~/.emacs= is created for you if you have no init file.  This interface is
great for beginners, but one major drawback is that it's a bit difficult to
share settings since it's not amicable to copy-pasting.

We shall use =~/.emacs.d/init.el= as the initialisation file so that /all/ of our
Emacs related files live in the /same/ directory: =~/.emacs.d/=.

A raw code file is difficult to maintain, especially for a /large/ system such as
Emacs. Instead, we're going with a ‘literate programming’ approach: The
intialisation configuration is presented in an essay fromat, along with headings
and subheadings, intended for consumption by humans such as myself, that,
incidentally, can be ‘tangled’ into a raw code file that is comprehensible by a
machine. We achieve this goal using [[#Life-within-Org-mode][org-mode]] ---/Emacs' killer app/--- which is
discussed in great detail later on.

*** /Adventure time!/ “Honey, where's my init?”

Let's use the three possible locations for the initialisation files
to explore how Emacs finds them. Make the following three files.

_~/.emacs.el_
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Emacs looks for this first;
(set-background-color "chocolate3")
(message-box ".emacs.el says hello")
#+end_src
_~/.emacs_
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; else; looks for this one;
(set-background-color "plum4")
(message-box ".emacs says hello")
#+end_src
_~/.emacs.d/init.el_
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Finally, if neither are found; it looks for this one.
(set-background-color "salmon")
(message-box ".emacs.d/init.el says hello")
#+end_src

Now restart your Emacs to see how there super tiny initilaisation files
affect your editor. Delete some of these files in-order for others to take effect!

*** /Adventure time!/ Using Emacs' Easy Customisation Interface

We have chosen not to keep configurations in ~~/.emacs~ since
Emacs may explicitly add, or alter, code in it.

Let's see this in action!

Execute the following to see additions to the ~~/.emacs~ have been added by
‘custom’.
1. =M-x customize-variable RET line-number-mode RET=
2. Then press: ~toggle~, ~state~, then ~1~.
3. Now take a look: =C-x C-f ~/.emacs=

*** Support for ‘Custom’

Let the Emacs customisation GUI insert configurations into its own file, not
touching or altering my initialisation file.  For example, I tend to have local
variables to produce ~README.org~'s and other matters, so Emacs' Custom utility
will remember to not prompt me each time for the safety of such local variables.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
(load custom-file)
#+end_src

Speaking of local variables, let's always ones we've already marked as safe
---see the bottom of the source of this file for an example of local variables.
( At one point, all my files had locals! )
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq enable-local-variables :safe)
#+end_src

** =use-package= ---The start of =init.el=

There are a few ways to install packages ---run ~C-h C-e~ for a short overview.
The easiest, for a beginner, is to use the command ~package-list-packages~ then
find the desired package, press ~i~ to mark it for installation, then install all
marked packages by pressing ~x~.

- /Interactively/:  ~M-x list-packages~ to see all melpa packages that can install
  - Not in alphabetical order, so maybe search with ~C-s~.
  - Press ~Enter~ on a package to see its description.
- Or more quickly, to install, say, the haskell mode: ~M-x package-install RET
    unicode-fonts RET~.

“From rags to riches”: Recently I switched to Mac ---first time trying the OS.
I had to do a few ~package-install~'s and it was annoying.  I'm looking for the
best way to package my Emacs installation ---including my installed packages and
configuration--- so that I can quickly install it anywhere, say if I go to
another machine.  It seems ~use-package~ allows me to configure and auto install
packages.  On a new machine, when I clone my ~.emacs.d~ and start Emacs, on the
first start it should automatically install and compile all of my packages
through ~use-package~ when it detects they're missing.

First we load ~package~, the built-in package manager.  It is by default only
connected to the GNU ELPA (Emacs Lisp Package Archive) repository, so we
extended it with other popular repositories; such as the much larger [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]
(Milkypostman's ELPA) ---it builds packages [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][directly from the source-code
reposistories of developers]], rather than having all packages in one repository.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Make all commands of the “package” module present.
(require 'package)

;; Internet repositories for new packages.
(setq package-archives '(("org"       . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
                         ("gnu"       . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa"     . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/")))

;; Actually get “package” to work.
(package-initialize)
(package-refresh-contents)
#+end_src

- All installed packages are placed, by default, in =~/.emacs.d/elpa=.
- *Neato:* /If one module requires others to run, they will be installed automatically./

The declarative configuration tool [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/][use-package]] is a
macro/interface that manages other packages and the way they interact.
- It allows us to tersely organise a package's configuration.
  - By default, ~(use-package foo)~ only loads a package, if it's on our system.
    - Use the standalone keyword ~:disabled~ to turn off loading
      a module that, say, you're not using anymore.
- It is /not/ a package manger, but we can make it one by having it automatically
  install modules, via Emacs packing mechanism, when they're not in our system.

  We achieve this by using the keyword option ~:ensure t~.
- Here are common keywords we will use, in super simplified terms.
  - ~:init   f₁ … fₙ~  /Always/ executes code forms ~fᵢ~ /before/ loading a package.
  - ~:diminish str~  Uses /optional/ string ~str~ in the modeline to indicate
    this module is active. Things we use often needn't take
    real-estate down there and so no we provide no ~str~.
  - ~:config f₁ … fₙ~ /Only/ executes code forms ~fᵢ~ /after/ loading a package.

    The remaining keywords only take affect /after/ a module loads.

  - ~:bind ((k₁ . f₁) … (kₙ . fₙ)~ Lets us bind keys ~kᵢ~, such as
    ~"M-s o"~, to functions, such as =occur=.
    - When /n = 1/, the extra outer parenthesis are not necessary.
  - ~:hook ((m₁ … mₙ) . f)~ Enables functionality ~f~ whenever we're in one of the
    modes ~mᵢ~, such as ~org-mode~. The ~. f~, along with the outermost parenthesis,
    is optional and defaults to the name of the package ---Warning: Erroneous
    behaviour happens if the package's name is not a function provided by the
    package; a common case is when package's name does /not/ end in ~-mode~,
    leading to the invocation ~((m₁ … mₙ) . <whatever-the-name-is>-mode)~ instead.

    Additionally, when /n = 1/, the extra outer parenthesis are not necessary.
  - ~:custom (k₁ v₁ d₁) … (kₙ vₙ dₙ)~ Sets a package's custom variables ~kᵢ~ to have
    values ~vᵢ~, along with /optional/ user documentation ~dᵢ~ to explain to yourself,
    in the future, why you've made this decision.

    This is essentially ~setq~ within ~:config~.

We now bootstrap ~use-package~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(require 'use-package)
#+end_src

We can now invoke ~(use-package XYZ :ensure t)~ which should check for the ~XYZ~
package and make sure it is accessible.  If not, the ~:ensure t~ part tells
~use-package~ to download it ---using the built-in ~package~ manager--- and place it
somewhere accessible, in =~/.emacs.d/elpa/= by default.  By default we would like
to download packages, since I do not plan on installing them manually by
downloading Lisp files and placing them in the correct places on my system.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src
The use of ~:ensure t~ only installs absent modules, but it does no updating.
Let's set up [[https://github.com/rranelli/auto-package-update.el][an auto-update mechanism]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package auto-package-update
  :config
  ;; Delete residual old versions
  (setq auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t)
  ;; Do not bother me when updates have taken place.
  (setq auto-package-update-hide-results t)
  ;; Update installed packages at startup if there is an update pending.
  (auto-package-update-maybe))
#+end_src

Here's another example use of ~use-package~.  Later on, I have a “show recent files
pop-up” command set to ~C-x C-r~; but what if I forget? This mode shows me all key
completions when I type ~C-x~, for example.  Moreover, I will be shown other
commands I did not know about! Neato :-)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Making it easier to discover Emacs key presses.
(use-package which-key
  :diminish
  :config (which-key-mode)
          (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)
          (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.05))
#+end_src
⟨ Honestly, I seldom even acknowledge this pop-up; but it's always nice to show
to people when I'm promoting Emacs. ⟩

Above, the ~:diminish~ keyword indicates that we do not want the mode's name to be
shown to us in the modeline ---the area near the bottom of Emacs.  It does so by
using the ~diminish~ package, so let's install that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package diminish
  :config ;; Let's hide some markers.
    (diminish 'eldoc-mode)
    (diminish 'org-indent-mode)
    (diminish 'subword-mode))
#+end_src

Here are other packages that I want to be installed onto my machine.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Efficient version control.
(use-package magit
  :config (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status))

(use-package htmlize)
;; Main use: Org produced htmls are coloured.
;; Can be used to export a file into a coloured html.

;; Quick BibTeX references, sometimes.
(use-package biblio)

;; Get org-headers to look pretty! E.g., * → ⊙, ** ↦ ◯, *** ↦ ★
;; https://github.com/emacsorphanage/org-bullets
(use-package org-bullets
  :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))

;; Haskell's cool
(use-package haskell-mode)

;; Lisp libraries with Haskell-like naming.
(use-package dash)    ;; “A modern list library for Emacs”
(use-package s   )    ;; “The long lost Emacs string manipulation library”.

;; Library for working with system files;
;; e.g., f-delete, f-mkdir, f-move, f-exists?, f-hidden?
(use-package f)
#+end_src

Note:
- [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]]: “A modern list library for Emacs”
  - E.g., ~(--filter (> it 10) (list 8 9 10 11 12))~
- [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s]]: “The long lost Emacs string manipulation library”.
  - E.g., ~s-trim, s-replace, s-join~.

** ~README~ ---From ~init.org~ to ~init.el~

Rather than manually extracting the Lisp code from this literate document each
time we alter it, let's instead add a ‘hook’ ---a method that is invoked on a
particular event, in this case when we save the file.  More precisely, in this
case, ~C-x C-s~ is a normal save whereas ~C-u C-x C-s~ is a save after forming
~init.elc~ and ~README.md~.

     I enjoy reading others' /literate/ configuration files and

Alternatively, evaluate the above source block with ~C-c C-c~ to produce a ~README~
file.

Notes:
- Github supports several markup languages, one of which is Org-mode.
  - It seems that Github uses [[https://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby][org-ruby]] to convert org-mode to html.
  - [[https://github.com/novoid/github-orgmode-tests][Here]] is a repo demonstrating how Github interprets Org-mode files.
  - org-ruby supports inline ~#+HTML~ but [[https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby/issues/51][not html blocks]].

- It seems coloured HTML does not render well:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (org-html-export-to-html)
  (shell-command "mv README.html README.md")
  #+end_src
- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/JavaScript-support.html][JavaScript supported display of web pages]] with:
  #+begin_src org :tangle no
  ,#+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:t buttons:t
  #+end_src
  This looks nice for standalone pages, but doesn't incorporate nicely with
  github README.org.

The above mentioned package ~toc-org~, which creates an up-to-date table
of contents in an org file, at any heading tagged ~:TOC:~.  It's useful
primarily for README files on Github.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package toc-org
  ;; Automatically update toc when saving an Org file.
  :hook (org-mode . toc-org-mode))

;; Make toc-org links appear to be the same as their visible text.
(defun toc-org-hrefify-org (str &optional hash)
  "Given a heading, transform it into a href using the org-mode rules."
  (toc-org-format-visible-link str))
#+end_src

I'm not sure how I feel about actually having the Github-serving TOC in my
source file. It's nice to have around, from an essay-perspecive, but it breaks
HTML export since its links are /not/ well-behaved; e.g., ~:ignore:~-ed headlines
appear in the toc, but do not link to any visible heading in the HTML; likewise,
headings with URLS in their names break. As such, below I've developed a way to
erase it altogether ---alternatively, one could mark the toc as ~:noexport:~, but
this would then, in my current approach, not result in a toc in the resulting
README.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(cl-defun my/org-replace-tree-contents (heading &key (with "") (offset 0))

** Installing Emacs packages directly from source

[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][Quelpa]] allows us to build Emacs packages directly from source repositories.  It
derives its name from the German word /Quelle/, for /souce/ [code], adjoined to
ELPA.  Its ~use-package~ interface allows us to use ~use-package~ like normal but
when we want to install a file from souce we use the keyword ~:quelpa t~.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package quelpa-use-package)
#+end_src

Let's use this to obtain an improved info-mode from the EmacsWiki.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package info+
  :quelpa (info+ :fetcher wiki :url "https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/info%2b.el"))
#+end_src

** =magit= ---Emacs' porcelain interface to git
Let's setup an Emacs ‘porcelain’ interface to git ---it makes working with
version control tremendously convenient.  Moreover, I add a little pop-up so
that I don't forget to commit often!

Why use ~magit~ as the interface to the git version control system?  In ~magit~
buffer nearly everything can be acted upon: Press =return=, or =space=, to see
details and =tab= to see children items, usually.

First, let's setup our git credentials.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; See here for a short & useful tutorial:
;; https://alvinalexander.com/git/git-show-change-username-email-address
(when (equal ""
(shell-command-to-string "git config user.name"))
  (shell-command "git config --global user.name \"Musa Al-hassy\"")
  (shell-command "git config --global user.email \"alhassy@gmail.com\""))
#+end_src

Below is my personal quick guide to working with magit ---for a full tutorial
see [[http://jr0cket.co.uk/2012/12/driving-git-with-emacs-pure-magic-with.html.html][jr0cket's blog]].

- ~dired~ :: See the contents of a particular directory.

- ~magit-init~ :: Put a project under version control.
     The mini-buffer will prompt you for the top level folder version.
     A ~.git~ folder will be created there.

- ~magit-status~ , ~C-x g~ :: See status in another buffer.
     Press ~?~ to see options, including:
  - g :: Refresh the status buffer.
  - TAB :: See collapsed items, such as what text has been changed.
  - ~q~ :: Quit magit, or go to previous magit screen.
  - ~s~ :: Stage, i.e., add, a file to version control.
       Add all untracked files by selecting the /Untracked files/ title.

       [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/119807/185815][The staging area is akin to a pet store; commiting is taking the pet home.]]

  - ~k~ :: Kill, i.e., delete a file locally.
  - ~K~ :: This' ~(magit-file-untrack)~ which does ~git rm --cached~.
  - ~i~ :: Add a file to the project ~.gitignore~ file. Nice stuff =)
  - ~u~ :: Unstage a specfif staged change highlighed by cursor.
       ~C-u s~ stages everything --tracked or not.
  - ~c~ :: Commit a change.
    - A new buffer for the commit message appears, you write it then
      commit with ~C-c C-c~ or otherwise cancel with ~C-c C-k~.
      These commands are mentioned to you in the minibuffer when you go to commit.
    - You can provide a commit to /each/ altered chunk of text!
      This is super neat, you make a series of local such commits rather
      than one nebulous global commit for the file. The ~magit~ interface
      makes this far more accessible than a standard terminal approach!
    - You can look at the unstaged changes, select a /region/, using ~C-SPC~ as usual,
      and commit only that if you want!
    - When looking over a commit, ~M-p/n~ to efficiently go to previous or next altered sections.
    - Amend a commit by pressing ~a~ on ~HEAD~.

  - ~d~ :: Show differences, another ~d~ or another option.
    - This is magit! Each hunk can be acted upon; e.g., ~s~ or ~c~ or ~k~ ;-)
  - ~v~ :: Revert a commit.
  - ~x~ :: Undo last commit. Tantamount to ~git reset HEAD~~ when cursor is on most recent
       commit; otherwise resets to whatever commit is under the cursor.
  - ~l~ :: Show the log, another ~l~ for current branch; other options will be displayed.
    - Here ~space~ shows details in another buffer while cursour remains in current
      buffer and, moreover, continuing to press ~space~ scrolls through the other buffer!
      Neato.
  - ~P~ :: Push.
  - ~F~ :: Pull.
  - ~:~ :: Execute a raw git command; e.g., enter ~whatchanged~.

Notice that every time you press one of these commands, a ‘pop-up’ of realted
git options appears! Thus not only is there no need to memorise many of them,
but this approach makes /discovering/ other commands easier.

Below are the git repos I'd like to clone ---along with a function to do so
quickly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package magit)

;; Do not ask about this variable when cloning.
(setq magit-clone-set-remote.pushDefault t)

(cl-defun maybe-clone (remote &optional (local (concat "~/" (file-name-base remote))))
  "Clone a REMOTE repository if the LOCAL directory does not exist.

Yields ‘repo-already-exists’ when no cloning transpires,
otherwise yields ‘cloned-repo’.

LOCAL is optional and defaults to the base name; e.g.,
if REMOTE is https://github.com/X/Y then LOCAL becomes ~/Y."
  (if (file-directory-p local)
      'repo-already-exists
    (async-shell-command (concat "git clone " remote " " local))
    (add-to-list 'magit-repository-directories `(,local   . 0))
    'cloned-repo))

(maybe-clone "https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d" "~/.emacs.d")
(maybe-clone "https://github.com/alhassy/alhassy.github.io")
(maybe-clone "https://github.com/alhassy/CheatSheet")
(maybe-clone "https://github.com/alhassy/ElispCheatSheet")
(maybe-clone "https://github.com/alhassy/CatsCheatSheet")
(maybe-clone "https://github.com/alhassy/islam")

;; For brevity, many more ‘maybe-clone’ clauses are hidden in the source file.
#+end_src
Let's always notify ourselves of a file that has [[https://tpapp.github.io/post/check-uncommitted/][uncommited changes]]
---we might have had to step away from the computer and forgotten to commit.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'magit-git)

(defun my/magit-check-file-and-popup ()
  "If the file is version controlled with git
  and has uncommitted changes, open the magit status popup."
  (let ((file (buffer-file-name)))
    (when (and file (magit-anything-modified-p t file))
      (message "This file has uncommited changes!")
      (when nil ;; Became annyoying after some time.
      (split-window-below)
      (other-window 1)
      (magit-status)))))

;; I usually have local variables, so I want the message to show
;; after the locals have been loaded.
(add-hook 'find-file-hook
  '(lambda ()
      (add-hook 'hack-local-variables-hook 'my/magit-check-file-and-popup)))
#+end_src

Finally, one of the main points for using version control is to have access to
historic versions of a file. The following utility allows us to ~M-x
git-timemachine~ on a file and use ~p/n/g/q~ to look at previous, next, goto
arbitrary historic versions, or quit.
- If we want to roll back to a previous version, we just ~write-file~ or ~C-x C-s~
  as usual! The power of text!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package git-timemachine)
#+end_src

** Syncing to the System's =$PATH=
For one reason or another, on OS X it seems that an Emacs instance
begun from the terminal may not inherit the terminal's environment
variables, thus making it difficult to use utilities like ~pdflatex~
when Org-mode attempts to produce a PDF.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :init
  (when (memq window-system '(mac ns x))
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)))
#+end_src

See the [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] documentation for setting other environment variables.
** Keeping my system up to date
Let's ensure our system is always up to date.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/stay-up-to-date ()
  "Ensure that OS and Emacs package listings are up to date.

   Takes ~5 seconds when everything is up to date."
  (async-shell-command "brew update && brew upgrade")
  (other-window 1)
  (rename-buffer "Keeping-system-up-to-date")

  (package-refresh-contents 'please-do-so-in-the-background)
  (message "Updated Emacs package manager.")
  (other-window 1))

(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'my/stay-up-to-date)

;; For now, doing this since I'm also calling my/stay-up-to-date with
;; after-init-hook which hides the startup message.
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'display-startup-echo-area-message)
#+end_src

** Installing OS packages from within Emacs ---Amethyst!

Sometimes Emacs packages depend on existing system binaries, ~use-package~ let's
us ensure these exist using the ~:ensure-system-package~ keyword extension.

- This is like ~:ensure t~ but operates at the OS level and uses your default
  OS package manager.

Let's obtain the extension.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Auto installing OS system packages
(use-package use-package-ensure-system-package)
#+end_src
Here's an example use:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(shell-command-to-string "type rg") ;; ⇒ rg not found
(use-package rg
  :ensure-system-package rg) ;; ⇒ There's a buffer *system-packages*
                             ;;   installing this tool at the OS level!
#+end_src
If you look at the ~*Messages*~ buffer, via ~C-h e~, on my machine it says
~brew install rg: finished~ ---it uses ~brew~ which is my OS package manager!

- The [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package#use-package-ensure-system-package][use-package-ensure-system-package]] documentation for a flurry of use cases.

The extension makes use of [[https://gitlab.com/jabranham/system-packages][system-packages]]; see its documentation to learn
more about managing installed OS packages from within Emacs. This is itself
a powerful tool, however it's interface ~M-x system-packages-install~ leaves much
to be desired ---namely, tab-compleition listing all available packages,
seeing their descriptions, and visiting their webpages.
This is remedied by [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages][M-x helm-system-packages]] then ~RET~ to see a system
package's description, or ~TAB~ for the other features!
/This is so cool!/

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; An Emacs-based interface to the package manager of your operating system.
(use-package helm-system-packages)
#+end_src

The Helm counterpart is great for /discovarability/, whereas
the plain ~system-packages~ is great for /programmability/.

It is tedious to arrange my program windows manually, and as such I love tiling
window managers, which automatically arrange them.  I had been using [[https://xmonad.org][xmonad]]
until recently when I obtained a Mac machine and now use [[https://ianyh.com/amethyst/][Amethyst]] ---“Tiling
window manager for macOS along the lines of xmonad.”

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Unlike the Helm variant, we need to specify our OS pacman.
(setq system-packages-package-manager 'brew)

;; Use “brew cask install” instead of “brew install” for installing programs.
(setf (nth 2 (assoc 'brew system-packages-supported-package-managers))
      '(install . "brew cask install"))

;; If the given system package doesn't exist; install it.
;; (system-packages-ensure "amethyst")
#+end_src

Neato! Now I can live in Emacs even more ^_^

** Who am I? ---Using Gnus for Gmail
Let's set the following personal Emacs-wide variables ---to be used in other
locations besides email.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name    "Musa Al-hassy"
      user-mail-address "alhassy@gmail.com")
#+end_src

By default, in Emacs, we may send mail: Write it in Emacs with ~C-x m~,
then press ~C-c C-c~ to have it sent via your OS's default mailing system
---mine appears to be Gmail via the browser. Or cancel sending mail with
~C-c C-k~ ---the same commands for org-capturing, discussed below (•̀ᴗ•́)و

To send and read email in Emacs we use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnus][GNUS]], which, like GNU itself, is a
recursive acronym: GNUS Network User Service.

1. Execute, rather place in your init:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
        (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
   #+end_src
   Revert to the default OS mailing method by setting this variable to
   ~mailclient-send-it~.

2. Follow only the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail#toc1][quickstart here]]; namely, make a file named ~~/.gnus~ containing:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.gnus
        ;; user-full-name and user-mail-address should be defined

   (setq gnus-select-method
         '(nnimap "gmail"
                  (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com")
                  (nnimap-server-port "imaps")
                  (nnimap-stream ssl)))

   (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "smtp.gmail.com"
         smtpmail-smtp-service 587
         gnus-ignored-newsgroups "^to\\.\\|^[0-9. ]+\\( \\|$\\)\\|^[\"]\"[#'()]")
   #+end_src

3. Enable “2 step authentication” for Gmail following [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/33309/10352][these]] instructions.

4. You will then obtain a secret password, the ~x~ marks below, which you insert
   in a file named ~~/.authinfo~ as follows ---using your email address.
   #+begin_src shell :tangle no
        machine imap.gmail.com login alhassy@gmail.com password xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx port imaps
        machine smtp.gmail.com login alhassy@gmail.com password xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx port 587
   #+end_src

5. In Emacs, ~M-x gnus~ to see what's there.

   Or compose mail with ~C-x m~ then send it with ~C-c C-c~.
   - Press ~C-h m~ to learn more about message mode for mail composition; or
     read the [[https://www.gnus.org/manual/message.pdf][Message Manual]].

In gnus, by default items you've looked at disappear ---i.e., are archived.
They can still be viewed in, say, your online browser if you like.
In the ~Group~ view, ~R~ resets gnus, possibly retriving mail or alterations
from other mail clients. ~q~ exits gnus in ~Group~ mode, ~q~ exits the particular
view to go back to summary mode. Only after pressing ~q~ from within a group
do changes take effect on articles ---such as moves, reads, deletes, etc.

- RET :: Open an article.

- B m :: Move an article, in its current state, to another group ---i.e.,
     ‘label’ using Gmail parlance.

     Something to consider doing when finished with an article.

     To delete an article, simply move it to ‘trash’ ---of course this will delete it
     in other mail clients as well. There is no return from trash.

     Emails can always be archieved ---never delete, maybe?

- ! :: Mark an article as read, but to be kept around ---e.g., you have not
     replied to it, or it requires more reading at a later time.

- R :: Reply to email with sender's content there in place.
  - ~r~ to reply to an email with sender's content in adjacent buffer.

- d :: Mark an article as done, i.e., read it and it can be archived.

Learn more by reading [[https://www.gnus.org/manual.html][The Gnus Manual]]; also available within Emacs by ~C-h i m
gnus~ (•̀ᴗ•́)و
- Or look at the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/gnus-refcard.pdf][Gnus Reference Card]].
- Or, less comprehensively, this [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/gnus-guide-en.org#subscribe-groups][outline]].
** Hydra: Supply a prefix only once
Sometimes we have keybindings that share a common prefix, say ~C-c j~ and ~C-c k~,
and we invoke them in an arbitrary sequence, it would be nice to invoke the
shared prefix /only once/ thereby having:
| ~C-c j C-c j C-c k C-c k M-3 C-c j M-5 C-c k~ | ≈ | ~C-c jjkk3j5k~ |

- The [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra#the-one-with-the-least-amount-of-code][“hydra-zoom”]] example from the documentation really showcases this utility.
- After the prefix is supplied, all extensions are shown in a minibuffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Invoke all possible key extensions having a common prefix by
;; supplying the prefix only once.
(use-package hydra)

;; The standard syntax:
;; (defhydra hydra-example (global-map "C-c v") ;; Prefix
;;   ;; List of triples (extension method description) )
#+end_src

From the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] repository is a ‘description for poets’:
#+begin_quote
Once you summon the Hydra through the prefixed binding (the body + any one
head), all heads can be called in succession with only a short extension.

The Hydra is vanquished once Hercules, any binding that isn't the Hydra's head,
arrives. Note that Hercules, besides vanquishing the Hydra, will still serve his
original purpose, calling his proper command. This makes the Hydra very
seamless, it's like a minor mode that disables itself auto-magically.
#+end_quote

See [[Taking a tour of one's edits]] below for a small and useful example.

** Persistent Scratch Buffer
The ~*scratch*~ buffer is a nice playground for temporary data.

However, by default its contents are not saved --which may be an issue if we
have not relocated our playthings to their appropriate files. Whence let's save
& restore the scratch buffer by default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package persistent-scratch
  ;; Enable both autosave and restore the last saved state of scratch
  ;; buffer, if any, on Emacs start.
  :config (persistent-scratch-setup-default))
#+end_src

We might accidentally close this buffer, so we could utilise the following.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun scratch ()
   "Recreate the scratch buffer, loading any persistent state."
   (interactive)
   (switch-to-buffer-other-window (get-buffer-create "*scratch*"))
   (insert initial-scratch-message)
   (ignore-errors (persistent-scratch-restore))
   (persistent-scratch-autosave-mode 1)
   (org-mode)
   (local-set-key (kbd "C-x C-s") 'persistent-scratch-save))

;; This doubles as a quick way to avoid the common formula: C-x b RET *scratch*
#+end_src

I use Org-mode often, so that's how I want things to appear.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  "#+Title: Persistent Scratch Buffer"

I may not use the spacemacs [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/StarterKits][starter kit]], since I do not like evil-mode and find
spacemacs to “hide things” from me ---whereas Emacs “”encourages” me to learn
more---, however it is a configuration and I enjoy reading Emacs configs in
order to improve my own setup. From Spacemacs I've adopted Helm for list
completion, its sleek light & dark themes, and its modified powerline setup.

The ‘modeline’ is a part near the bottom of Emacs that gives information about
the current mode, as well as other matters --such as time & date, for example.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; When using helm & info & default, mode line looks prettier.
(use-package spaceline
  :custom (spaceline-buffer-encoding-abbrev-p nil)
          (spaceline-line-column-p nil)
          (spaceline-line-p nil)
          (powerline-default-separator 'arrow)
  :config (require 'spaceline-config)
          (spaceline-helm-mode)
          (spaceline-info-mode)
          (spaceline-emacs-theme))
#+end_src

Other separators I've considered include ~'brace~ instead of an arrow,
and ~'contour, 'chamfer, 'wave, 'zigzag~ which look like browser tabs
that are curved, boxed, wavy, or in the style of driftwood.

** Flashing when something goes wrong ---no blinking
Make top and bottom of screen flash when something unexpected happens thereby
observing a warning message in the minibuffer. E.g., C-g, or calling an unbound
key sequence, or misspelling a word.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq visible-bell 1)
#+end_src
Enable flashing mode-line on errors.  On MacOS, this shows a caution symbol ^_^

A blinking cursor rushes me to type; let's slow down.
… Recentely I'm thinking that a blinking cursours prompts me to continue
upwards and onwards.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(blink-cursor-mode 1)
#+end_src

** My to-do list: The initial buffer when Emacs opens up
I almost always have Emacs open; I don't need a dashboard, but would like to see
my to-do list and my init file, side-by-side.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(find-file "~/Dropbox/todo.org")
(split-window-right)			  ;; C-x 3
(other-window 1)                              ;; C-x 0
(let ((enable-local-variables :all)           ;; Load *all* locals.
      (org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))       ;; Eval *all* blocks.
  (find-file "~/.emacs.d/init.org"))
#+end_src

** Showing date, time, and battery life
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-time-day-and-date t)
(display-time)

;; (display-battery-mode -1)
;; Nope; let's use a fancy indicator …
;;
(use-package fancy-battery
  :diminish
  :custom (fancy-battery-show-percentage  t)
          (battery-update-interval       15)
  :config (fancy-battery-mode))
#+end_src

This will show remaining battery life, coloured green if charging
and coloured yellow otherwise. It is important to note that
this package is no longer maintained. It works on my machine.

** Hiding Scrollbar, tool bar, and menu
As a laptop user, screen space is important, so let's remove rarely used visual
items.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(tool-bar-mode   -1)  ;; No large icons please
(scroll-bar-mode -1)  ;; No visual indicator please
(menu-bar-mode   -1)  ;; The Mac OS top pane has menu options
#+end_src

** Increase/decrease text size
The ‘usual’ text zoom keys ~C-±~ …
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-+") 'text-scale-increase)
(global-set-key (kbd "C--") 'text-scale-decrease)
;; C-x C-0 restores the default font size
#+end_src

If thou knowst the ELisp, forgive this shadowing of the ~negative-argument~
… we've still got ~M--~ though.

** Delete Selection Mode

Delete Selection mode lets you treat an Emacs region much like a typical text
selection outside of Emacs: You can replace the active region.  We can delete
selected text just by hitting the backspace key.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(delete-selection-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Highlight & complete parenthesis pair when cursor is near ;-)
Highlight parens within matching parens when near one of them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq show-paren-delay 0)
(setq show-paren-style 'mixed)
(show-paren-mode)
#+end_src

Colour parens, and other delimiters, depending on their depth.
Very useful for parens heavy languages like Lisp.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :disabled
  :hook ((org-mode prog-mode text-mode) . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+end_src

For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(blue (purple (forest (green (yellow (blue))))))
#+end_src

There is a powerful package called ‘smartparens’ for working with pair-able
characters, but I've found it to be too much for my uses. Instead I'll utilise
the lightweight package ~electric~, which Emacs provides out of the box.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(electric-pair-mode 1)
#+end_src

It supports, by default, ACSII pairs ~{}, [], ()~ and Unicode ~‘’, “”, ⟪⟫, ⟨⟩~.

When writing Lisp, it is annoyong to have ‘<’ and ‘>’ be completed
/and/ considered as pairs.  Let's disassociate them from both notions.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; The ‘<’ and ‘>’ are not ‘parenthesis’, so give them no compleition.
(setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate
      (lambda (c)
        (or (member c '(?< ?> ?~)) (electric-pair-default-inhibit c))))

;; Treat ‘<’ and ‘>’ as if they were words, instead of ‘parenthesis’.
(modify-syntax-entry ?< "w<")
(modify-syntax-entry ?> "w>")
#+end_src

Let's add the org-emphasises markers: If we select a word then press
=*=, it becomes bold; likewise for ~/~ for emphasise.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq electric-pair-pairs
         '(;; (?~ . ?~)
           (?* . ?*)
           (?/ . ?/)))
#+end_src
I use ‘~’ too much when that the compleition for it is annoying.
Let's also, for example, avoid obtaining double ‘~’ and ‘/’ when searching for a file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Disable pairs when entering minibuffer
(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook (lambda () (electric-pair-mode 0)))

;; Renable pairs when existing minibuffer
(add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook (lambda () (electric-pair-mode 1)))
#+end_src

** Minibuffer should display line and column numbers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; (line-number-mode t)
(column-number-mode t)
#+end_src

For line numbers on the side of the buffer; moreover let's have a
uniform width for displaying line numbers, rather than having the
width grow as necessary.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-width-start t)
(global-display-line-numbers-mode      t)
#+end_src

** Never lose the cursor
Reduce mental strain of locating the cursour when navigation happens;
e.g., when we switch windows or scroll, we get a wave of light near the cursor.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package beacon
  :config (setq beacon-color "#666600")
  :hook   ((org-mode text-mode) . beacon-mode))
#+end_src
** Neotree: Directory Tree Listing
We open a nifty file manager upon startup.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Fancy icons for neotree
;; Only do this once:
(use-package all-the-icons
  :config (all-the-icons-install-fonts 'install-without-asking))

;; Sidebar for project file navigation
(use-package neotree
  :config (global-set-key "\C-x\ d" 'neotree-toggle)
          (setq neo-theme 'icons)
          (neotree-refresh))

;; Open it up upon startup.
;; (neotree-toggle)
#+end_src
By default ~C-x d~ invokes ~dired~, but I prefer ~neotree~ for file
management.

⟨ Edit: As a naive user, this is what I thought; yet a year later,
                I've almost never used neotree. ⟩

Useful navigational commands include
- ~U~ to go up a directory.
- ~C-c C-c~ to change directory focus; ~C-C c~ to type the directory out.
- ~?~ or ~h~ to get help and ~q~ to quit.

As always, to go to the neotree pane when it's the only other window,
execute ~C-x o~.

I /rarely/ make use of this feature; company mode & Helm together quickly provide
an automatic replacement for nearly all of my uses.

** Tabs                                                            :Disabled:
I really like my Helm-supported ~C-x b~, but the visial appeal of a [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/awesome-tab][tab bar]] for Emacs
is interesting. Let's try it out and see how long this lasts ---it may be like Neotree:
Something cute to show to others, but not as fast as the keyboard.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package awesome-tab
  :disabled
  :quelpa (awesome-tab :fetcher git :url "https://github.com/manateelazycat/awesome-tab.git")
  :config (awesome-tab-mode t))

;; Show me /all/ the tabs at once, in one group.
(defun awesome-tab-buffer-groups ()
  (list (awesome-tab-get-group-name (current-buffer))))
#+end_src

It's been less than three days and I've found this utility to be unhelpful, to me anyhow.

** Window resizing using the golden ratio                          :Disabled:
Let's load the following package, which automatically resizes windows so that
the window containing the cursor is the largest, according to the golden ratio.
Consequently, the window we're working with is nice and large yet the other windows
are still readable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package golden-ratio
  :disabled
  :diminish golden-ratio-mode
  :init (golden-ratio-mode 1))
#+end_src

After some time this got a bit annoying and I'm no longer  using this.

* Prose
Let's setup a spellchecker and other expected features of a word processing tool
---however these features apply Emacs-wide since nearly everything is
essentially text (•̀ᴗ•́)و

** Fill-mode ---Word Wrapping
In fill mode, when you type past the end of a line, Emacs automatically starts a
new line, cleverly formatting paragraphs. This is a powerful form of “word
wrap”.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Let's avoid going over 80 columns
(setq fill-column 80)

;; Wrap long lines when editing text
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+end_src

We may press ~M-q~ to cleverly redistribute the line breaks within any paragraph,
thereby making it look better. With a prefix argument, it justifies it as well
---i.e., pads extra white space to make the paragraph appear rectangular.

Note that ~M-o M-s~ centres a line of text ;-) Fun stuff!

** Fix spelling as you type --thesaurus & dictionary too!
I would like to check spelling by default.
- ~C-;~ :: Cycle through corrections for word at point.
- ~M-$~ :: Check and correct spelling of the word at point
- ~M-x ispell-change-dictionary RET TAB~ :: To see what dictionaries are available.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package flyspell
  :hook ((prog-mode . flyspell-prog-mode)
         (text-mode . flyspell-mode)))
#+end_src

Enabling fly-spell for text-mode enables it for org and latex modes since they
derive from text-mode.

Flyspell needs a spell checking tool, which is not included in Emacs.  We
install ~aspell~ spell checker using, say, homebrew via ~brew install aspell~.  Note
that Emacs' ~ispell~ is the interface to such a command line spelling utility.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ispell-program-name "/usr/local/bin/aspell")
(setq ispell-dictionary "en_GB") ;; set the default dictionary

(diminish 'flyspell-mode) ;; Don't show it in the modeline.
#+end_src

Let us select a correct spelling merely by clicking on a word.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load "flyspell"
  ' (progn
     (define-key flyspell-mouse-map [down-mouse-3] #'flyspell-correct-word)
     (define-key flyspell-mouse-map [mouse-3] #'undefined)))
#+end_src

Colour incorrect works; default is an underline.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-font-lock-mode t)
(custom-set-faces '(flyspell-incorrect ((t (:inverse-video t)))))
#+end_src

Finally, save to user dictionary without asking:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ispell-silently-savep t)
#+end_src

Let's keep track of my personal word set by having it be in my version controlled
.emacs directory. [[http://aspell.net/man-html/Format-of-the-Personal-and-Replacement-Dictionaries.html][Note]] that the default location is ~~/.[i|a]spell.DICT~ for
a specified dictionary ~DICT~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ispell-personal-dictionary "~/.emacs.d/.aspell.en.pws")
#+end_src

Nowadays, I very rarely write non-literate programs, but if I do
I'd like to check spelling only in comments/strings. E.g.,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook          'c-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)
#+end_src

Use the thesaurus Emacs frontend [[https://github.com/hpdeifel/synosaurus][Synosaurus]] to avoid unwarranted repetition.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package synosaurus
  :diminish synosaurus-mode
  :init    (synosaurus-mode)
  :config  (setq synosaurus-choose-method 'popup) ;; 'ido is default.
           (global-set-key (kbd "M-#") 'synosaurus-choose-and-replace)
)
#+end_src
The thesaurus is powered by the Wordnet ~wn~ tool, which can be invoked without an internet connection!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (shell-command "brew cask install xquartz &") ;; Dependency
;; (shell-command "brew install wordnet &")
#+end_src

Let's use Wordnet as a dictionary via the [[https://github.com/gromnitsky/wordnut][wordnut]] package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package wordnut
 :bind ("M-!" . wordnut-lookup-current-word))

;; Use M-& for async shell commands.
#+end_src
Use ~M-↑,↓~ to navigate dictionary results, and ~wordnut-search~ for a new search.

Use this game to help you learn to spell words that you're having trouble with;
see ~~/Dropbox/spelling.txt~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload 'typing-of-emacs "~/.emacs.d/typing.el" "The Typing Of Emacs, a game." t)
#+end_src

Practice touch typing using [[https://github.com/hagleitn/speed-type][speed-type]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package speed-type)
#+end_src
Running ~M-x speed-type-region~ on a region of text, or ~M-x speed-type-buffer~ on a
whole buffer, or just ~M-x speed-type-text~ will produce the selected region, buffer,
or random text for practice. The timer begins when the first key is pressed
and stats are shown when the last letter is entered.

Other typing resources include:
- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TypingOfEmacs][Typing of Emacs]] --an Emacs alternative to speed type, possibly more engaging.
- [[https://alternativeto.net/software/klavaro/][Klavaro]] --a GUI based yet language-independent typing tutor.
  - I'm enjoying this tool in getting started with Arabic typing.
  - The plan is to move to using the online [[https://makinghijrah.com/arabic-typing/][Making Hijrah]] tutor which
    concludes the basic lesson plan with a few short narrations.
- [[https://typing.io/][Typing.io]] is a tutor for coders: Lessons are based on open source code, such
  some XMonad written in Haskell or Linux written in  C.
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/index.html#downloading][GNU Typist]] --which is interactive in the terminal, so not ideal in Emacs--,

To assist in language learning, it may be nice to have an Emacs
[[https://github.com/atykhonov/google-translate][interface]] to Google translate ---e.g., invoke ~google-translate-at-point~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package google-translate
 :config
   (global-set-key "\C-ct" 'google-translate-at-point)
)
#+end_src

Select the following then ~C-c t~,
#+begin_quote
Hey buddy, what're you up to?
#+end_quote
Then /detect language/ then /Arabic/ to obtain:
#+begin_quote
مرحباً يا صديقي ، ماذا تفعل؟
#+end_quote
Neato 😲

** Using a Grammar & Style Checker
Let's install [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-langtool][a grammar and style checker]].
We get the offline tool from the bottom of the [[https://languagetool.org/][LanguageTool]] website, then relocate it
as follows.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package langtool
 :config
  (setq langtool-language-tool-jar
     "~/Applications/LanguageTool-4.5/languagetool-commandline.jar")
)
#+end_src

Now we can run ~langtool-check~ on the subsequent grammatically incorrect
text ---which is from the LanguageTool website--- which colours errors in red,
when we click on them we get the reason why; then we may invoke
~langtool-correct-buffer~ to quickly use the suggestions to fix each correction,
and finally invoke ~langtool-check-done~ to stop any remaining red colouring.

#+begin_example org
LanguageTool offers spell and grammar checking. Just paste your text here
and click the 'Check Text' button. Click the colored phrases for details
on potential errors. or use this text too see an few of of the problems
that LanguageTool can detecd. What do you thinks of grammar checkers?
Please not that they are not perfect. Style issues get a blue marker:
It's 5 P.M. in the afternoon. The weather was nice on Thursday, 27 June 2017
--uh oh, that's the wrong date ;-)
#+end_example

By looking around the source code, I can do all three stages smoothly (•̀ᴗ•́)و
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Quickly check, correct, then clean up /region/ with M-^

(add-hook 'langtool-error-exists-hook
  (lambda ()
     (langtool-correct-buffer)
     (langtool-check-done)))

(global-set-key "\M-^"
                (lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (message "Grammar checking begun ...")
                  (langtool-check)))
#+end_src

The checking command is silent, we added a bit of comforting acknowledgement to the user.

** Lightweight Prose Proofchecking
Let's [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode][write good]]!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package writegood-mode
  ;; Load this whenver I'm composing prose.
  :hook (text-mode org-mode)
  ;; Some additional weasel words.
  :config
  (--map (push it writegood-weasel-words)
         '("some" "simple" "simply" "easy" "often" "easily" "probably"
           "clearly"               ;; Is the premise undeniably true?
           "experience shows"      ;; Whose? What kind? How does it do so?
           "may have"              ;; It may also have not!
           "it turns out that")))  ;; How does it turn out so?
           ;; ↯ What is the evidence of highighted phrase? ↯
#+end_src

Inspired by Matt Might's [[http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/][3 shell scripts to improve your writing, or
"My Ph.D. advisor rewrote himself in bash"]], this Emacs interface
emphasises, via underline, the following weaknesses in writing ---so
that I can fix them or decide that they are appropriate for the
scenario.

Sentences that cut out the following problems may become stronger
---by being more terse or precise.

- Weasel Words ::
     Phrases that sound good without conveying information;
     such as vague precision or subjective phrases.

     E.g., /a number of, surprisingly, very close/.

     It's okay not to have exact details, but rather than “I don't know”
     explain why not and what the next steps will be.

- Passive Voice ::
     Phrases wherein interest is in the object experiencing an action,
     rather than the subject that performs the action.

  - Bad: The house /was built by/ my father.
  - Good: My father /built/ this house.

  Likewise, including relevant or explanatory information as in “X
  guarantees Y” is an improvement over “Y is guaranteed”.

  Sometimes the subject really is irrelevant, such as
  “We did X” whereas “X happened” suffices.

  👍 If the relevant subject is unclear and, also, the text reads
  better in the active, then change a phrase.

- Duplicated Words :: Occurrences of, say, “the the”.

     Harder to catch manually, but easier mechanically ;-)

** Placeholder Text ---For Learning & Experimenting
When learning about Emacs formatting commands, such as zap-to-char ~M-z~
or transpose ~M-t~, it's best to have filler text ---even better when
it's automatically generated instead of typing it out ourselves. The
following will give us a series of commands ~lorem-ipsum-insert-⋯~ for
inserting lists, sentences, paragraphs and using a prefix argument,
with ~C-u~, we can request to generate any number of them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package lorem-ipsum)
#+end_src

‘Lorem’ is not a word itself, but it comes from the Latin ‘Dolorem Ipsum’
which means “pain in and of itself”.

See this [[https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Emacs Cheat Sheet]] to try out the textual navigation and formatting
bindings on lorem ipsum, gibberish text.

** Unicode Input via Agda Input
[[https://mazzo.li/posts/AgdaSort.html][Agda]] is one of my favourite languages, it's like Haskell on steroids.  Let's set
it up for the main sake of its Unicode input ---you may do likewise using TeX
input.  ( [[https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/][The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively
Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)]] )

Executing ~agda-mode setup~ appends the following text to the ~.emacs~ file.
Let's put it here ourselves.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file (let ((coding-system-for-read 'utf-8))
                (shell-command-to-string "/usr/local/bin/agda-mode locate")))
#+end_src

I almost always want the ~agda-mode~ input method.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'agda-input)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (set-input-method "Agda")))
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook  (lambda () (set-input-method "Agda")))
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Unicode doesn't intend to cover things that are achievable with markup, so only
a limited subset of the alphabet is available as subscript; but all is available
as superscript, except ‘q’.

ₐₑₕᵢⱼₖₗₘₙₒₚᵣₛₜᵤᵥₓ

~brew cask install font-symbola~
⇒ Includes fonts for subscripts; e.g., ₐₙₑₕᵢⱼₖₗₘₙₒₚₜₛ
#+end_quote

Below are my personal Agda input symbol translations;
e.g., ~\set → 𝒮ℯ𝓉~. Note that we could give a symbol new Agda TeX binding
interactively: ~M-x customize-variable agda-input-user-translations~ then
~INS~ then for key sequence type ~set~ then ~INS~ and for string paste ~𝒮ℯ𝓉~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations '("set" "𝒮ℯ𝓉"))
#+end_src
Better yet, as a loop:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

        )
      do (add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations item))
#+end_src
Also some silly stuff:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; angry, cry, why-you-no
(add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations
   '("whyme" "ლ(ಠ益ಠ)ლ" "ヽ༼ಢ_ಢ༽ﾉ☂" "щ(゜ロ゜щ)"))
;; confused, disapprove, dead, shrug
(add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations
   '("what" "「(°ヘ°)" "(ಠ_ಠ)" "(✖╭╮✖)" "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"))
;; dance, csi
(add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations
   '("cool" "┏(-_-)┓┏(-_-)┛┗(-_-﻿ )┓" "•_•)

(add-to-list 'agda-input-user-translations
   '("smile" "♥‿♥" "(─‿‿─)" "(•̀ᴗ•́)و" "(งಠ_ಠ)ง"))
#+end_src

Finally let's effect such translations.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; activate translations
(agda-input-setup)
#+end_src

Note that the effect of [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_n_unicode.html][Emacs unicode input]] could be approximated using
~abbrev-mode~.

** Taking a tour of one's edits
This package allows us to move around the edit points of a buffer
/without/ actually undoing anything. We even obtain a brief description
of what happend at each edit point.
This seems useful for when I get interrupted or lose my train of
thought: Just press ~C-c e ,~ to see what I did recently and where
---the “e” is for “e”dit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Give me a description of the change made at a particular stop.
(use-package goto-chg
  :init (setq glc-default-span 0))

(defhydra hydra-edits (global-map "C-c e")
  ("," goto-last-change "Goto nᵗʰ last change")
  ("." goto-last-change-reverse "Goto more recent change"))
#+end_src

Compare this with ~C-x u~, or ~undo-tree-visualise~, wherein undos are actually performed.

Notice, as a hydra, I can use ~C-c e~ followed by any combination of
~,~ and ~.~ to navigate my recent edits /without/ having to supply the prefix
each time.

** Moving Text Around
This extends Org-mode's ~M-↑,↓~ to other modes, such as when coding.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; M-↑,↓ moves line, or marked region; prefix is how many lines.
(use-package move-text)
(move-text-default-bindings)
#+end_src

** Enabling CamelCase Aware Editing Operations
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ccmode/Subword-Movement.html][Subword]] movement lets us treat “EmacsIsAwesome” as three words
─“Emacs”, “Is”, and “Awesome”─ which is desirable since such naming
is common among coders. Now, for example, ~M-f~ moves along each subword.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-subword-mode 1)
#+end_src

* Life within Org-mode
Let's obtain Org-mode along with the extras that allow us to ignore
heading names, but still utilise their contents ---e.g., such as a heading
named ‘preamble’ that contains org-mode setup for a file.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org
  :ensure org-plus-contrib
  :config
  (require 'ox-extra)
  (ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines)))
#+end_src

~org-plus-contrib~ contain the files that are included with Emacs plus all
  contributions from the [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/src/master/contrib][org-mode repoistory]].
- Use the ~:ignore:~ tag on headlines you'd like to have ignored,
  while not ignoring their content.
- Use the ~:noexport:~ tag to omit a headline /and/ its contents.

Now, let's replace the content marker, “⋯”, with a nice
unicode arrow.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ellipsis " ⤵")
#+end_src
Also:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Fold all source blocks on startup.
(setq org-hide-block-startup t)

;; Lists may be labelled with letters.
(setq org-list-allow-alphabetical t)

;; Avoid accidentally editing folded regions, say by adding text after an Org “⋯”.
(setq org-catch-invisible-edits 'show)

;; I use indentation-sensitive programming languages.
;; Tangling should preserve my indentation.
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)

;; Tab should do indent in code blocks
(setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)

;; Give quote and verse blocks a nice look.
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)

;; Pressing ENTER on a link should follow it.
(setq org-return-follows-link t)
#+end_src

I rarely use tables, but here is a useful [[http://notesyoujustmightwanttosave.blogspot.com/][Org-Mode Table Editing Cheatsheet]] and
a [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/spreadsheet.html][friendly tutorial]].

Moreover, since I end up using org-mode most of the time, let's make that the
default mode.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq initial-major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src

** High Speed Literate Programming

*** Manipulating Sections
Let's enable the [[http://notesyoujustmightwanttosave.blogspot.com/2011/12/org-speed-keys.html][Org Speed Keys]] so that when the cursor is at the beginning of
a headline, we can perform fast manipulation & navigation using the standard Emacs movement
controls, such as
- ~#~ toggle ~COMMENT~-ing for an org-header.
- ~s~ toggles “narrowing” to a subtree; i.e., hide the rest of the document.

  If you narrow to a subtree then any export, ~C-c C-e~, will only consider
  the narrowed detail.

- ~I/O~ clock In/Out to the task defined by the current heading.
  - Keep track of your work times!
  - ~v~ view agenda.
- ~u~ for jumping upwards to the parent heading.
- ~c~ for cycling structure below current heading, or ~C~ for cycling global structure.
- ~i~ insert a new same-level heading below current heading.
- ~w~ refile current heading; options list pops-up to select which heading to move it to. Neato!
- ~t~ cycle through the available TODO states.
- ~^~ sort children of current subtree; brings up a list of sorting options.
- ~n/p~ for next/previous /visible/ heading.
- ~f/b~ for jumping forward/backward to the next/previous /same-level/ heading.
- ~D/U~ move a heading down/up.
- ~L/R~ recursively promote (move leftwards) or demote (more rightwards) a heading.
- ~1,2,3~ to mark a heading with priority, highest to lowest.

We can add our own speed keys by altering the ~org-speed-commands-user~ variable.

Moreover, ~?~ to see a complete list of keys available.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-use-speed-commands t)
#+end_src

*** Seamless Navigation Between Source Blocks
Finally, let's use the “super key” --aka the command or windows key--
to jump to the previous, next, or toggle editing org-mode source blocks.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Overriding keys for printing buffer, duplicating gui frame, and isearch-yank-kill.
;;
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "s-p") #'org-babel-previous-src-block)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "s-n") #'org-babel-next-src-block)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "s-e") #'org-edit-src-code)
(define-key org-src-mode-map (kbd "s-e") #'org-edit-src-exit)
#+end_src

Interestingly, ~s-l~ is “goto line”.

*** Modifying ~<return>~
- ~C-RET, C-S-RET~ make a new heading where the latter marks it as a ~TODO~.
- By default ~M-RET~ makes it easy to work with existing list items, headings, tables, etc
  by creating a new item, heading, etc.
- Usually we want a newline then we indent, let's make that the default.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook '(lambda ()
     (local-set-key (kbd "<return>") 'org-return-indent))
     (local-set-key (kbd "C-M-<return>") 'electric-indent-just-newline))
  #+end_src

  Notice that I've also added another kind of return, for when I want to
  break-out of the indentation approach and start working at the beginning of
  the line.

In summary,
| key            | method                                    | behaviour                           |
|----------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~<return>~     | ~org-return-indent~                       | Newline with indentation            |
| ~M-<return>~   | ~org-meta-return~                         | Newline with new org item           |
| ~C-M-<return>~ | ~electric-indent-just-newline~            | Newline, cursor at start            |
| ~C-<return>~   | ~org-insert-heading-respect-content~      | New heading /after/ current content |
| ~C-S-<return>~ | ~org-insert-todo-heading-respect-content~ | Ditto, but with a ~TODO~ marker     |

*** ~C-a,e,k~ and Yanking of sections
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; On an org-heading, C-a goes to after the star, heading markers.
;; To use speed keys, run C-a C-a to get to the star markers.
;;
;; C-e goes to the end of the heading, not including the tags.
;;
(setq org-special-ctrl-a/e t)

;; C-k no longer removes tags, if activated in the middle of a heading's name.
(setq org-special-ctrl-k t)

;; When you yank a subtree and paste it alongside a subtree of depth ‘d’,
;; then the yanked tree's depth is adjusted to become depth ‘d’ as well.
;; If you don't want this, then refile instead of copy pasting.
(setq org-yank-adjusted-subtrees t)
#+end_src

** Executing code from ~src~ blocks
For example, to execute a shell command in emacs,
write a ~src~ with a shell command, then ~C-c c-c~ to see the results.
Emacs will generally query you to ensure you're sure about executing the
(possibly dangerous) code block; let's stop that:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; Seamless use of babel: No confirmation upon execution.
;; Downside: Could accidentally evaluate harmful code.
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+end_src

A worked out example can be obtained as follows: ~<g TAB~ then ~C-c C-C~ to make a nice
simple graph --the code for this is in the next section.

Some initial languages we want org-babel to support:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '(
     (emacs-lisp . t)
     ;; (shell	 . t)
     (python . t)
     (haskell . t)
     (ruby	 . t)
     (ocaml	 . t)
     (C . t)  ;; Captial “C” gives access to C, C++, D
     (dot	 . t)
     (latex	 . t)
     (org	 . t)
     (makefile	 . t)
     ))

;; Preserve my indentation for source code during export.
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)

;; The export process hangs Emacs, let's avoid this.
;; MA: For one reason or another, this crashes more than I'd like.
;; (setq org-export-in-background t)
#+end_src

More languages can be added using ~add-to-list~.

** Hiding Emphasise Markers & Inlining Images
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-mode math is now highlighted ;-)
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex))

;; Hide the *,=,/ markers
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)

;; (setq org-pretty-entities t)
;; to have \alpha, \to and others display as utf8 http://orgmode.org/manual/Special-symbols.html
#+end_src

The following is now disabled --it makes my system slower than I'd like.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; Let's set inline images.
(setq org-display-inline-images t)
(setq org-redisplay-inline-images t)
(setq org-startup-with-inline-images "inlineimages")

;; Automatically convert LaTeX fragments to inline images.
(setq org-startup-with-latex-preview t)
#+end_src

** ~ox-extra~: Using ~:ignore:~ to ignore headings but use the bodies
** Org-Emphasise for Parts of Words                                :Disabled:
From [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/24540651/3550444][stackoverflow]], the following incantation allows us to have
parts of works emphasied with org-mode; e.g.,
/half/ed, ~half~ed, and right in the m*idd*le! Super cool stuff!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setcar org-emphasis-regexp-components " \t('\"{[:alpha:]")
(setcar (nthcdr 1 org-emphasis-regexp-components) "[:alpha:]- \t.,:!?;'\")}\\")
(org-set-emph-re 'org-emphasis-regexp-components org-emphasis-regexp-components)
#+end_src

I've disabled this feature since multiple occurrences
of an emphasise marker are sometimes treated as one
lengthy phrase being emphasised.

** Working with Citations
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][An exquisite system]] for handling references.

The following entity will display useful data
when the mouse hovers over it (•̀ᴗ•́)و If you click on it, then you're
in for a lot of super neat stuff, such as searching for the pdf online!

[[#agda_overview][agda_overview]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; Files to look at when no “╲bibliography{⋯}” is not present in a file.
;; Most useful for non-LaTeX files.
(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("~/thesis-proposal/papers/References.bib"))
(setq bibtex-completion-bibliography (car reftex-default-bibliography))

(use-package org-ref
  :demand t
  :config (setq org-ref-default-bibliography reftex-default-bibliography))

(use-package helm-bibtex :demand t)
#+end_src

Execute ~M-x helm-bibtex~ or ~C-c ] and, say, enter ~agda~ and you will be presented with
all the entries in the bib database that mention ‘agda’. Super cool stuff.

Read the manual [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/blob/master/org-ref.org][online]] or better yet as an org-file with ~M-x org-ref-help~.

** Show off-screen Heading at the top of the window
In case we forgot which heading we're under, let's keep
the current heading stuck at the top of the window.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (use-package org-sticky-header
  :hook (org-mode . org-sticky-header-mode)
  :config
  (setq-default
   org-sticky-header-full-path 'full
   ;; Child and parent headings are seperated by a /.
   org-sticky-header-outline-path-separator " / "))
#+end_src

** Clocking Work Time
Let's keep track of the time we spend working on tasks that we may have captured for ourselves the previous day.
Such statistics provides a good idea of how long it actually takes me to accomplish a certain task in the future
and it lets me know where my time has gone.

- Clock in :: on a heading with ~I~, or in the subtree with ~C-c C-x C-i~.
- Clock out :: of a heading with ~O~, or in the subtree with ~C-c C-x C-o~.
- Clock report :: See clocked times with ~C-c C-x C-r~.

After clocking out, the start and end times, as well as the elapsed time, are added to a drawer
to the heading. We can punch in and out of tasks as many times as desired, say we took a break or
switched to another task, and they will all be recorded into the drawer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Record a note on what was accomplished when clocking out of an item.
(setq org-log-note-clock-out t)
#+end_src

To get started, we could estimate how long a task will take and clock-in;
then clock-out and see how long it actually took.

Moreover, we can overlay due dates and priorities to tasks in a non-intrusive way that is
easy to edit by hand.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; List of all the files & directories where todo items can be found. Only one for now.
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/todo.org"))

;; How many days ahead the default agenda view should look
(setq org-agenda-ndays 7)

;; How many days early a deadline item will begin showing up in your agenda list.
(setq org-deadline-warning-days 14)

;; In the agenda view, days that have no associated tasks will still have a line showing the date.
(setq org-agenda-show-all-dates t)

(setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)

;; Scheduled items marked as complete will not show up in your agenda view.
(setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)

;; The agenda view – even in the 7-days-at-a-time view – will always begin on the current day.
;; This is important, since while using org-mode as a day planner, you never want to think of
;; days gone past. That’s something you do in other ways, such as when reviewing completed tasks.
(setq org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil)
#+end_src

Sometimes, at the beginning at least, I would accidentally invoke the transposed
command ~C-x C-c~, which saves all buffers and quits Emacs. So here's a helpful
way to ensure I don't quit Emacs accidentally.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq confirm-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Resume clocking task when emacs is restarted
(org-clock-persistence-insinuate)

;; Show lot of clocking history
(setq org-clock-history-length 23)

;; Resume clocking task on clock-in if the clock is open
(setq org-clock-in-resume t)

;; Sometimes I change tasks I'm clocking quickly - this removes clocked tasks with 0:00 duration
(setq org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks t)

;; Clock out when moving task to a done state
(setq org-clock-out-when-done t)

;; Save the running clock and all clock history when exiting Emacs, load it on startup
(setq org-clock-persist t)

;; Do not prompt to resume an active clock
;; (setq org-clock-persist-query-resume nil)

;; Include current clocking task in clock reports
(setq org-clock-report-include-clocking-task t)
#+end_src

*Finding tasks to clock in*
Use one of the following options, with the top-most being the first to be tried.
- From anywhere, ~C-u C-c C-x C-i~ yields a pop-up for recently clocked in tasks.
- Pick something off today's agenda scheduled items.
- Pick a ~Started~ task from the agenda view, work on this unfinished task.
- Pick something from the ~TODO~ tasks list in the agenda view.

- ~C-c C-x C-d~ also provides a quick summary of clocked time for the current org file.

*Estimates versus actual time*
Before clocking into a task, add to the properties drawer ~:Effort: 1:25~ or ~C-c C-x C-e~, for a task
that you estimate will take an hour an twenty-five minutes, for example. Now the modeline
will have will mention the time elapsed alongside the task name.
- This is also useful when you simply want to put a time limit on a task that wont be
  completed anytime soon, say writing a thesis or a long article, but you still want
  to work on it for an hour a day and be warned when you exceed such a time constraint.

  When you've gone above your estimate time, the modeline shows it to be red.

** [[https://revealjs.com/?transition=zoom#/][Reveal.JS]] -- The HTML Presentation Framework
Org-mode documents can be transformed into beautiful slide decks
with [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/blob/master/Readme.org][org-reveal]] with the following two simple lines.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-reveal
  :config (setq org-reveal-root "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js"))
#+end_src

For example, execute, ~C-x C-e~ after the closing parenthesis of, the following block to see an example slide-deck (─‿‿─)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(progn (shell-command "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjwen/org-reveal/696613edef0fe17a9c53146f79933fe7c4101100/Readme.org >> Trying_out_reveal.org")
       (switch-to-buffer (find-file "Trying_out_reveal.org"))
       (org-reveal-export-to-html-and-browse))
#+end_src

Org-mode exporting, ~C-c C-e~, now includes an option ~R~ for such reveal slide decks.

Two dimensional slides may be a bit new to some people, so I like to give viewers
an option, in tiny font, to view the slide-deck continuously and remind them that ~?~ provides useful shortcuts.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-reveal-title-slide "<h1>%t</h1> <h3>%a</h3>
<font size=\"1\">
<a href=\"?print-pdf&showNotes=true\">
⟪ Flattened View ; Press <code>?</code> for Help ⟫
</a>
</font>")
#+end_src
One should remove the ~&showNotes=true~ if they do not want to include speaker notes in the flattened view.

Within the flatenned view, one may wish to ~CTRL/CMD+P~ then save the resulting PDF locally.

** Coloured LaTeX using Minted
Execute the following for bib ref as well as minted
Org-mode uses the Minted package for source code highlighting in PDF/LaTeX
--which in turn requires the pygmentize system tool.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-listings 'minted
      org-latex-packages-alist '(("" "minted"))
      org-latex-pdf-process
      '("pdflatex -shell-escape -output-directory %o %f"
        "biber %b"
        "pdflatex -shell-escape -output-directory %o %f"
        "pdflatex -shell-escape -output-directory %o %f")
)
#+end_src

For faster pdf generation, possibly with errors, consider invoking:
#+begin_example emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-pdf-process
      '("pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+end_example

By default, Org exports LaTeX using the ~nonstopmode~ option, which tries
its best to produce a PDF ---which ignores typesetting errors altogether,
which is not necessary ideal when using LaTeX.

** Jumping without hassle
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-goto-line (line)
  "Go to the indicated line, unfolding the parent Org header.

   Implementation: Go to the line, then look at the 1st previous
   org header, now we can unfold it whence we do so, then we go
   back to the line we want to be at.
  "
  (interactive "nEnter line: ")
  (goto-line line)
  (org-previous-visible-heading 1)
  (org-cycle)
  (goto-line line)
)
#+end_src

** Folding within a subtree
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-fold-current-subtree-anywhere-in-it ()
  "Hide the current heading, while being anywhere inside it."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (org-narrow-to-subtree)
    (org-shifttab)
    (widen)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook '(lambda ()
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-h") 'my/org-fold-current-subtree-anywhere-in-it)))
#+end_src

** Ensuring Useful HTML Anchors
Upon HTML export, each tree heading is assigned an ID to be used for hyperlinks.
Default IDs are something like ~org1957a9d~, which does not endure the test of time:
Re-export will produce a different id. Here's a rough snippet to generate
IDs from headings, by replacing spaces with hyphens, for headings without IDs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun my/ensure-headline-ids (&rest _)
  "Org trees without a :CUSTOM_ID: property have the property set to be their heading. All non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with ‘-’.

   If multiple trees end-up with the same id property, issue a message and undo
   any property insertion thus far.
  "
  (interactive)
  (let ((ids))
    (org-map-entries
     (lambda ()
       (org-with-point-at (point)
         (let ((id (org-entry-get nil "CUSTOM_ID")))
           (unless id
             (setq id (s-replace-regexp "[^[:alnum:]]" "-" (nth 4 (org-heading-components))))
             (if (not (member id ids))
                 (push id ids)
               (message-box "Oh no, a repeated id!\n\n\t%s" id)
               (undo)
               (setq quit-flag t))
             (org-entry-put nil "CUSTOM_ID" id))))))))

;; Whenever html & md export happens, ensure we have headline ids.
(advice-add 'org-html-export-to-html :before 'my/ensure-headline-ids)
(advice-add 'org-md-export-to-markdown :before 'my/ensure-headline-ids)
#+end_src

One may then use ~[[#my-custom-id]]~ to link to the entry with ~CUSTOM_ID~ property
~my-custom-id~.

Interestingly, ~org-set-property~, ~C-c C-x p~, lets us insert a property from
a selection of available ones, then we'll be prompted for a value for it
from a list of values you've used elsewhere. This is useful for remaining
consistent for when trees share similar properties.

(cl-defun my/org-run-haskell (&optional target (filename (buffer-name)))
  "Tangle Haskell source blocks of given ‘filename’, or otherwise current buffer,
   and load the resulting ‘target’ file into a ghci buffer.

   If no name is provided for the ‘target’ file that is generated from the
   tangeling process, it is assumed to be the buffer's name with a ‘hs’ extension.

   Note that this only loads the blocks tangled to ‘target’.

   For example, file ‘X.org’ may have haskell blocks that tangle to files
   ‘X.hs’, ‘Y.hs’ and ‘Z.hs’. If no target name is supplied, we tangle all blocks
   but only load ‘X.hs’ into the ghci buffer. A helpful technique to load the
   last, bottom most, defined haskell module, is to have the module declaration's
   source block be ‘:tangle (setq CODE “Y.hs”)’, for example; then the following
   code blocks will inherit this location provided our Org file has at the top
   ‘#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle (current-module))’.
   Finally, our ‘compile-command’ suffices to be ‘(my/org-run-haskell CODE)’.

   This technique structures “Interactive Way to C”.

** Backups
By default, Emacs saves backup files -- those ending in ~ -- in the current directory, thereby cluttering it up. Let's place them in ~~/.emacs.d/backups~, in case we need to look for a backup; moreover,
let's keep old versions since there's disk space to go around
--what am I going to do with 500gigs when nearly all my ‘software’ is
textfiles interpreted within Emacs 😼

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; New location for backups.
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups")))

;; Never silently delete old backups.
(setq delete-old-versions -1)

;; Use version numbers for backup files.
(setq version-control t)

;; Even version controlled files get to be backed up.
(setq vc-make-backup-files t)
#+end_src

Why backups? Sometimes I may forget to submit a file, or edit, to my
version control system, and it'd be nice to be able to see a local
automatic backup. Whenever ‘I need space,’ then I simply empty
the backup directory, if ever. That the backups are numbered is so sweet ^_^

Like package installations, my backups are not kept in any version control
system, like git; only locally.

Let's use an elementary diff system for backups.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package backup-walker
  :commands backup-walker-start)
#+end_src

In a buffer that corresponds to a file, invoke ~backup-walker-start~
to see a visual diff of changes /between/ versions.
By default, you see the changes ‘backwards’: Red means
delete these things to get to the older version; i.e.,
the red ‘-’ are newer items.

** Editor Documentation with Contextual Information
/Emacs is an extensible self-documenting editor!/

Let's use a helpful Emacs /documentation/ system that cleanly shows a lot of
contextual information ---then let's /extend/ that to work as we want it to:
~C-h o~ to describe the symbol at point.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helpful)

(defun my/describe-symbol (symbol)
  "A “C-h o” replacement using “helpful”:
   If there's a thing at point, offer that as default search item.

   If a prefix is provided, i.e., “C-u C-h o” then the built-in
   “describe-symbol” command is used.

   ⇨ Pretty docstrings, with links and highlighting.
   ⇨ Source code of symbol.
   ⇨ Callers of function symbol.
   ⇨ Key bindings for function symbol.
   ⇨ Aliases.
   ⇨ Options to enable tracing, dissable, and forget/unbind the symbol!
  "
  (interactive "p")
  (let* ((thing (symbol-at-point))
         (val (completing-read
               (format "Describe symbol (default %s): " thing)
               (vconcat (list thing) obarray)
               (lambda (vv)
                (cl-some (lambda (x) (funcall (nth 1 x) vv))
                         describe-symbol-backends))
               t nil nil))
         (it (intern val)))

    (if current-prefix-arg
        (funcall #'describe-symbol it)
      (cond
       ((or (functionp it) (macrop it) (commandp it)) (helpful-callable it))
       (t (helpful-symbol it))))))

;; Keybindings.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h o") #'my/describe-symbol)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-h k") #'helpful-key)
#+end_src

I like [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful]] and wanted it to have the same behaviour as ~C-h o~, which
~helpful-at-point~ does not achieve. The incantation above makes ~C-h o~ use ~helpful~
in that if the cursor is on a symbol, then it is offered to the user as a
default search item for help, otherwise a plain search box for help
appears. Using a universal argument lets us drop to the built-in help command.

** ~M-n,p~: Word-at-Point Navigation
Let's mimic the ~C-n,p~ constructs from line to word, so that unoccupied ~M-n,p~ now
serve to take us to the next or previous instance of the word under the
cursor. This is less intrusive than searching ~C-s~ or listing all occurrences ~M-s
o~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package smartscan
  :config
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-n") 'smartscan-symbol-go-forward)
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-p") 'smartscan-symbol-go-backward)
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-'") 'my/symbol-replace))
#+end_src

Unfortunately, as it currently is, there is no universal argument support:
~C-u 2 M-p~ does /not/ take you to the second previous instance of a word
---the prefix is instead ignored.

The default symbol replacement is [[https://github.com/mickeynp/smart-scan/issues/23][over-zealous]] in that it replaces sub-terms
occurring as parts of larger words. Let's do something about that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/symbol-replace (replacement)
  "Replace all standalone symbols in the buffer matching the one at point."
  (interactive  (list (read-from-minibuffer "Replacement for thing at point: " nil)))
  (save-excursion
    (let ((symbol (or (thing-at-point 'symbol) (error "No symbol at point!"))))
      (beginning-of-buffer)
      ;; (query-replace-regexp symbol replacement)
      (replace-regexp (format "\\b%s\\b" (regexp-quote symbol)) replacement))))
#+end_src

Also …
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; C-n, next line, inserts newlines when at the end of the buffer
(setq next-line-add-newlines t)
#+end_src

** Highlight Defined Emacs Lisp Symbols
Usually Emacs only highlights macro names, the [[https://github.com/Fanael/highlight-defined][following]] incantation makes
it highlight all defined names ---as long as we're in Lisp mode, whence in
org-src blocks we use ~C-c '~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package highlight-defined)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'highlight-defined-mode)
#+end_src

Super helpful to avoid accidentally misspelling a word :smile:

** Highlighting TODO-s & Showing them in Magit
Basic support todos. By default these include:
TODO NEXT THEM PROG OKAY DONT FAIL DONE NOTE KLUDGE HACK TEMP FIXME
and any sequence of X's or ?'s of length at least 3: XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, …, ???, ????, ????, ….
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; NOTE that the highlighting works even in comments.
(use-package hl-todo
  ;; Enable it for text-like locations
  :hook ((text-mode org-mode prog-mode) . hl-todo-mode)
  :init
  ;; Adding new keywords
  (loop for kw in '("TEST" "MA" "WK" "JC")
        do (add-to-list 'hl-todo-keyword-faces (cons kw "#dc8cc3"))))
#+end_src

Lest these get buried in mountains of text, let's have them [[https://github.com/alphapapa/magit-todos][become
mentioned]] in a magit status buffer ---which uses the keywords from ~hl-todo~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; MA: The todo keywords work in code too!
(use-package magit-todos
  :after magit
  :after hl-todo
  :config
  ;; For some reason cannot use :custom with this package.
  (custom-set-variables
    '(magit-todos-keywords (list "TODO" "FIXME" "MA" "WK" "JC")))
  (magit-todos-mode))
#+end_src

Note that such TODO keywords are not propagated from sections that are
COMMENT-ed out in org-mode.

Open a Magit status buffer, or run ~magit-todos-list~ to show a dedicated to-do
list buffer. You can then peek at items with space, or jump to them with enter.

Seeing the TODO list with each commit is an incentive to actually tackle the
items there (•̀ᴗ•́)و

- Inline todo keywords are pickedup if they have a colon after them; e.g.,
  TODO: Example.

** What's changed & who's to blame?
Let's have, in a fringe, an indicator for altered regions in a version controlled
file. Moreover, let's stage-&-commit straight from a working buffer.
The symbols “+, =” appear in a fringe by default for alterations
---we may change these if we like.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Hunk navigation and commiting.
(use-package git-gutter+
  :ensure t
  ;; Shucks, this is way to slow for large files.
  ;; :init (global-git-gutter+-mode)
  :diminish (git-gutter+-mode))
#+end_src

Let's set a hydra so we can press ~C-x v n n p n~ to move the next two
altered hunks, move back one, then move to the next. This saves me having
to supply the prefix ~C-x v~ each time I navigate among my alterations.
At any point we may also press ~u 𝕩~ to denote ~C-u ⟪prefix⟫ 𝕩~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defhydra hydra-version-control (git-gutter+-mode-map "C-x v")
  "Version control"
  ;; (extension method description)
  ("n" git-gutter+-next-hunk "Next hunk")
  ("p" git-gutter+-previous-hunk "Previous hunk")
  ("=" git-gutter+-show-hunk "Show hunk diff")
  ("r" git-gutter+-revert-hunks "Revert hunk\n")
  ("c" git-gutter+-stage-and-commit "Stage & commit hunk")
  ("C" git-gutter+-stage-and-commit-whole-buffer "Stage & commit entire buffer")
  ("U" git-gutter+-unstage-whole-buffer "Unstage whole buffer"))
#+end_src

Commiting with ~C-x v c~ let's us use ~C-c C-k~ to cancel and ~C-c C-c~ to
submit the given message; ~C-c C-a~ to amend the previous commit.

Besides [[https://github.com/nonsequitur/git-gutter-plus][git-gutter+]] we may use diff-hl:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Colour fringe to indicate alterations.
;; (use-package diff-hl)
;; (global-diff-hl-mode)
#+end_src

A few more helpful version control features:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Popup for who's to blame for alterations.
(use-package git-messenger :demand t)
;;
;; Message menu let's us use magit diff to see the commit change.
(setq git-messenger:use-magit-popup t)
;;
;; Always show who authored the commit and when.
;; (setq git-messenger:show-detail t)

;; View current file in browser on github.
;; More generic is “browse-at-remote”.
(use-package github-browse-file)

;; Add these to the version control hydra.
;;
(defhydra hydra-version-control (git-gutter+-mode-map "C-x v")
  ("b" git-messenger:popup-message "Who's to blame?")
  ;; C-u C-x b ╱ u b ∷ Also show who authored the change and when.
  ("g" github-browse-file-blame "Show file in browser in github")
  ("s" magit-status "Git status of current buffer"))
#+end_src

Perhaps ~C-x v b~ will motivate smaller, frequent, commits.

Obtaining URL links to the current location of a file
---URLs are added to the kill ring.
Usefully, if [[https://gitlab.com/pidu/git-timemachine][git-timemachine-mode]] is active, the generated link
points to the version of the file being visited.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package git-link)

(defhydra hydra-version-control (git-gutter+-mode-map "C-x v")
  ("l" git-link "Git URL for current location"))
#+end_src

#+end_src

** Coding with a Fruit Salad: Semantic Highlighting
- /Syntax/ highlighting ⇨ Specific words are highlighted in strong colours so that
  the /structure/ can be easily gleaned.
  - Generally this only includes a language's keywords, such as ~if, loop, begin, end , cond~.
  - User defined names generally share one colour; usually black.
  - Hence, an ~if~ block may be seen as one coloured keyword followed by
    a blob of black text.

  /Obvious keywords are highlighted while the rest remains in black!/

- /Semantic/ highlighting ⇨ Identifiers obtain unique colouring.
  - This makes it much easier to visually spot dependencies with a quick glance.
    - One can *see* how data flows through a function.
  - In dynamic languages, this is a visual form of typing: Different colours are
    for different names.
    - Especially helpful for (library) names that are almost the same.
    - This can be accomplished anywhere in Emacs by pressing ~M-s h .~ on
      a selected phrase.

- Here are some reads:
  - [[https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e][Coding in color: How to make syntax highlighting more useful]] ---an excellent, terse, read
  - [[https://zwabel.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/c-ide-evolution-from-syntax-highlighting-to-semantic-highlighting/][C++ IDE Evolution: From Syntax Highlighting to Semantic Highlighting]]
    - Names with a similar prefix share a colour, and class-local items share a colour.
  - [[https://wordsandbuttons.online/lexical_differential_highlighting_instead_of_syntax_highlighting.html][Lexical differential highlighting instead of syntax highlighting]]
    - /Ideally, the smaller the lexical difference, the greater the color difference should be./
  - [[https://github.com/jacksonrayhamilton/context-coloring][Colouring by Context]] ---an Emacs package
  - [[http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/][A case against syntax highlighting]]


For Emacs, [[https://github.com/ankurdave/color-identifiers-mode][Color Identifiers Mode]] gives unique highlighting to identifiers.
- It comes with support for a bunch of languages, and one can add support for others.
- It picks colours adaptively to fit the theme; one uses ~M-x color-identifiers:regenerate-colors~ after a theme change.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package color-identifiers-mode)
(global-color-identifiers-mode)
#+end_src

When writing a new name, after about ~5 seconds it obtains a colour which is then
propagated immediately to any new occurrences. This timeout before recolouring
is to avoid any lag from multithreading and can be changed by altering the following
line (#64) in the source file, changing the ~5~ to a smaller number.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(run-with-idle-timer 5 t 'color-identifiers:refresh)))
#+end_src

** Completion Frameworks
[[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][Helm]] provides possible completions and also shows recently executed commands when pressing ~M-x~.

Extremely helpful for when switching between buffers, =C-x b=,
and discovering & learning about other commands!
E.g., press ~M-x~ to see recently executed commands and other possible commands!

Try and be grateful.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helm
 :diminish
 :init (helm-mode t)
 :bind
  ("C-x C-r" . helm-recentf)      ; search for recently edited

  ;; Helm provides generic functions for completions to replace
  ;; tab-completion in Emacs with no loss of functionality.
  ("M-x" . 'helm-M-x)
  ;; ("C-x b". 'helm-buffers-list) ;; Avoid seeing all those *helm⋯* mini buffers!
  ("C-x b". 'helm-mini) ;; see buffers & recent files; more useful.
  ("C-x r b" .'helm-filtered-bookmarks)
  ("C-x C-f" . 'helm-find-files)

  ;; A menu of all “top-level items” in a file; e.g.,
  ;; functions and constants in source code or headers in an org-mode file.
  ;;
  ;; Nifty way to familarise yourself with a new code base, or one from a while ago.
  ;;
  ("C-c i" . 'helm-imenu)

   ;; Show all meaningful Lisp symbols whose names match a given pattern.
   ;; Helpful for looking up commands.
   ("C-h a" . helm-apropos)

   ;; Look at what was cut recently & paste it in.
   ("M-y" . helm-show-kill-ring)
)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'execute-extended-command) ;; Default “M-x”

;; Yet, let's keep tab-completetion anyhow.
(define-key helm-map (kbd "TAB") #'helm-execute-persistent-action)
(define-key helm-map (kbd "<tab>") #'helm-execute-persistent-action)
;; We can list ‘actions’ on the currently selected item by C-z.
(define-key helm-map (kbd "C-z")  'helm-select-action)
#+end_src

When ~helm-mode~ is enabled, even help commands make use of it.
E.g., ~C-h o~ runs ~describe-symbol~ for the symbol at point,
and ~C-h w~ runs ~where-is~ to find the key binding of the symbol at point.
Both show a pop-up of other possible commands.

Let's ensure ~C-x b~ shows us: Current buffers, recent files, and bookmarks
─as well as the ability to create bookmarks, which is via ~C-x r b~ manually.
For example, I press ~C-x b~ then type any string and will have the option of
making that a bookmark referring to the current location I'm working in, or
jump to it if it's an existing bookmark, or make a buffer with that name,
or find a file with that name.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq helm-mini-default-sources '(helm-source-buffers-list
                                    helm-source-recentf
                                    helm-source-bookmarks
                                    helm-source-bookmark-set
                                    helm-source-buffer-not-found))
#+end_src

Incidentally, helm even provides an [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html#orgheadline24][interface]] for the top program via
~helm-top~. It also serves as an interface to popular search engines
and over 100 websites such as ~google, stackoverflow~, and ~arxive~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (shell-command "brew install surfraw &")
;;
;; Invoke helm-surfraw
#+end_src
If we want to perform a google search, with interactive suggestions,
then invoke ~helm-google-suggest~ --which can be acted for other serves,
such as Wikipedia or Youtube by ~C-z~. For more google specific options,
there is the ~google-this~ package.

Let's switch to a powerful searching mechanism -- [[https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop][helm-swoop]].
It allows us to not only search the current buffer but also
the other buffers and to make live edits by pressing ~C-c C-e~
when a search buffer exists. Incidentally, executing ~C-s~ on a word, region,
will search for that particular word, region; then apply changes by ~C-x C-s~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-swoop
  :bind
  (
   ("C-s"     . 'helm-swoop)           ;; search current buffer
   ("C-M-s"   . 'helm-multi-swoop-all) ;; Search all buffer
   ;; Go back to last position where ‘helm-swoop’ was called
   ("C-S-s" . 'helm-swoop-back-to-last-point)
  )
 :config ;; Following from helm-swoop's github page.
   ;; Give up colour for speed.
  (setq helm-swoop-speed-or-color nil)
  ;; If this value is t, split window inside the current window
  (setq helm-swoop-split-with-multiple-windows nil)

)
#+end_src

Press ~M-i~ after a search has executed to enable it for all buffers.

We can also limit our search to org files, or buffers of the same mode,
or buffers belonging to the same project!

Note that on the Mac, I can still perform default Emacs search using
/Cmd+f/.

Finally, let's enable [[https://company-mode.github.io/][“complete anything” mode]]
--it ought to start in half a second and only need two characters to get going,
which means word suggestions are provided and so I need only type partial words
then tab to get the full word!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company
  :diminish
  :config
    (setq company-dabbrev-other-buffers t
          company-dabbrev-code-other-buffers t

          company-complete-number t

          ;; M-⟪num⟫ to select an option according to its number.
          company-show-numbers t

          ;; Only 2 letters required for completion to activate.
          company-minimum-prefix-length 2

          ;; Do not downcase completions by default.
          company-dabbrev-downcase nil

          ;; Even if I write something with the ‘wrong’ case,
          ;; provide the ‘correct’ casing.
          company-dabbrev-ignore-case t

          ;; Immediately activate completion.
          company-idle-delay 0
          )

    (global-company-mode 1)
)
;; So fast that we don't need this.
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") 'company-complete)
#+end_src
Note that ~M-/~ goes through a sequence of completions.
Note that besides the arrow keys, we can also use ~C-~ or ~M-~ with ~n, p~ to
navigate the options. Note that [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/360][by default]] company mode does not support completion for
phrases containing hyphens --this can be altered, if desired.

Besides boring word completition, let's add support for [[https://github.com/dunn/company-emoji][emojis]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company-emoji)
(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-emoji)
#+end_src

For example: 🥞 💻 🐵 ✉️😉 🐬 🌵.

➡️On a new line, write ~:~ then any letter to have a tool-tip appear.
All emoji names are lowercase. ◀

The libraries ~emojify, emojify-logos~ provides cool items like :haskell: :emacs: :org: :ruby: :python:.
Unfortunately they do not easily export to html with org-mode, so I'm not using
them.

Let [[https://github.com/expez/company-quickhelp][documentation pop-up]] when we pause on a completion.
This is very useful when editing in a particular coding language, say via
~C-c '~ for org-src blocks.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package company-quickhelp
 :config
   (setq company-quickhelp-delay 0.1)
   (company-quickhelp-mode)
)
#+end_src

** Text Folding with [[https://github.com/gregsexton/origami.el][Origami-mode]]
Let's use a feature-full folding mode.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package origami)
#+end_src

With basic support for one of my languages.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(push (cons 'agda2-mode (origami-markers-parser "{-" "-}"))
      origami-parser-alist)
#+end_src

With expected support for searching.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/search-hook-function ()
  (when origami-mode (origami-toggle-node (current-buffer) (point))))

;; Open folded nodes if a search stops there.
(add-hook 'helm-swoop-after-goto-line-action-hook #'my/search-hook-function)
;;
;; Likewise for incremental search, isearch, users.
;; (add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook #'my/search-hook-function)
#+end_src

Along with a hydra for super quick navigation and easily folding, unfolding blocks! Love this one ^_^
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defhydra folding-with-origami-mode (global-map "C-c f")
  ("h" origami-close-node-recursively "Hide")
  ("o" origami-open-node-recursively  "Open")
  ("t" origami-toggle-all-nodes  "Toggle buffer")
  ("n" origami-next-fold "Next")
  ("p" origami-previous-fold "Previous"))
#+end_src

* Helpful Utilities & Shortcuts
Here is a collection of Emacs-lisp functions that I have come to use in other files.

Disclaimer: I wrote much of the following /before/ I learned any lisp; everything below is probably terrible.

Let's save a few precious seconds,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; change all prompts to y or n
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

;; Enable ‘possibly confusing commands’
(put 'downcase-region 'disabled nil)
(put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)
(put 'narrow-to-region 'disabled nil)
(put 'narrow-to-page 'disabled nil)
#+end_src

** Emacs keybindings for my browser                                :Disabled:
#+begin_center
⟨ I was a bit too Emacs-happy at one-point; this' cool, but I rarely use it. ⟩
#+end_center

I've downloaded the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb/related][Vimium]] extension for Google Chrome,
and have copy-pasted [[https://gist.github.com/dmgerman/6f0e5f9ffc6484dfaf53][these]] Emacs key bindings into it.
Now ~C-h~ in my browser shows which Emacs-like bindings
can be used to navigate my browser ^_^

** Using Emacs in any text area on my OS                           :Disabled:
#+begin_center
⟨ I was a bit too Emacs-happy at one-point; this' cool, but I rarely use it. ⟩
#+end_center

Using the [[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere/#usage][Emacs-Anywhere]] tool, I can press ~Cmd Shift e~ to have an Emacs frame
appear, produce text with Emacs editing capabilities, then ~C-x 5 0~ to have the
resulting text dumped into the text area I was working in.

This way I can use Emacs literally anywhere for textual input!

For my Mac OSX:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(shell-command "curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere/master/install | bash")

(server-start)
#+end_src

The tools that use emacs-anywhere ---such as my web browser--- and emacs-anywhere
itself need to be given sufficient OS permissions:
#+begin_example org
System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility
#+end_example
Then check the emacs-anywhere box from the following gui and provide a keyboard shortcut:
#+begin_example org
System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services
#+end_example

(•̀ᴗ•́)و

I always want to be in Org-mode and input unicode:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'ea-popup-hook
  (lambda (app-name window-title x y w h)
    (org-mode)
    (set-input-method "Agda")))
#+end_src

** Bind ~recompile~ to ~C-c C-m~ -- “m” for “m”ake
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar my-keys-minor-mode-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "C-c C-m") 'recompile)
    map)
  "my-keys-minor-mode keymap.")

(define-minor-mode my-keys-minor-mode
  "A minor mode so that my key settings override annoying major modes."
  :init-value t
  :lighter " my-keys")

(my-keys-minor-mode)

(diminish 'my-keys-minor-mode) ;; Don't show it in the modeline.
#+end_src
** Reload buffer with ~f5~
I do this so often it's not even funny.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [f5] '(lambda () (interactive) (revert-buffer nil t nil)))
#+end_src

In Mac OS, one uses ~Cmd-r~ to reload a page and Emacs binds buffer reversion to ~Cmd-u~
--in Emacs, Mac's ~Cmd~ is referred to as the ‘super key’ and denoted ~s~.

Moreover, since I use Org-mode to generate code blocks and occasionally
inspect them, it would be nice if they automatically reverted when they
were regenerated --Emacs should also prompt me if I make any changes!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Auto update buffers that change on disk.
;; Will be prompted if there are changes that could be lost.
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Kill to start of line
Dual to ~C-k~,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; M-k kills to the left
(global-set-key "\M-k" '(lambda () (interactive) (kill-line 0)) )
#+end_src
** ~file-as-list~ and ~file-as-string~
Disclaimer: I wrote the following /before/ I learned any lisp; everything below is probably terrible.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun file-as-list (filename)
  "Return the contents of FILENAME as a list of lines"
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents filename)
    (split-string (buffer-string))))

(defun file-as-string (filename)
  "Return the contents of FILENAME as a list of lines"
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents filename)
    (buffer-string)))
#+end_src

** ~C-x k~ kills current buffer, ~C-u C-x k~ kills all others
Let's introduce a handy utility when I'd like to clean my buffers.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun kill-other-buffers ()
  "Kill all other buffers and other windows."
  (interactive)
  (mapc 'kill-buffer (delq (current-buffer) (buffer-list)))
  (delete-other-windows))
#+end_src

By default ~C-x k~ prompts to select which buffer
should be selected. I almost always want to kill
the current buffer, so let's not waste time making
such a tedious decision.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x k")
  '(lambda (&optional all)
     "Kill current buffer, or all if prefix is provided.
      Prompt only if there are unsaved changes."
     (interactive "P")
     (if all (kill-other-buffers)
       (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))))
#+end_src

** Switching from 2 horizontal windows to 2 vertical windows
I often find myself switching from a horizontal view of two windows in Emacs to a
vertical view. This requires a variation of ~C-x 1 RET C - x 3 RET C-x o X-x b RET~.
Instead I now only need to type ~C-|~ to make this switch.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun ensure-two-vertical-windows ()
  "I used this method often when programming in Coq."
 (interactive)
 (other-window 1)			;; C-x 0
 (let ((otherBuffer (buffer-name)))
   (delete-window)			;; C-x 0
   (split-window-right)			;; C-x 3
   (other-window 1)			;; C-x 0
   (switch-to-buffer otherBuffer)	;; C-x b RET
 )
 (other-window 1)
)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-|") 'ensure-two-vertical-windows)
#+end_src
** Obtaining Values of ~#+KEYWORD~ Annotations
Org-mode settings are, for the most part, in the form ~#+KEYWORD: VALUE~. Of notable interest
are the ~TITLE~ and ~NAME~ keywords. We use the following ~org-keywords~ function to obtain
the values of arbitrary ~#+THIS : THAT~ pairs, which may not necessarily be supported by native
Org-mode --we do so for the case, for example, of the ~CATEGORIES~ and ~IMAGE~ tags associated with an article.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Src: http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2013/05/05/Getting-keyword-options-in-org-files/
(defun org-keywords ()
  "Parse the buffer and return a cons list of (property . value) from lines like: #+PROPERTY: value"
  (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'keyword
                   (lambda (keyword) (cons (org-element-property :key keyword)
                                           (org-element-property :value keyword)))))

(defun org-keyword (KEYWORD)
  "Get the value of a KEYWORD in the form of #+KEYWORD: value"
  (cdr (assoc KEYWORD (org-keywords))))
#+end_src

Note that capitalisation in a ”#+KeyWord” is irrelevant.

See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-syntax.html][here]] on how to see the abstract syntax tree of an org file
and how to manipulate it.

** Quickly pop-up a terminal, run a command, close it ---and zsh
/Pop up a terminal, do some work, then close it using the same command./

[[https://github.com/kyagi/shell-pop-el][Shell-pop]] uses only one key action to work:
If the buffer exists, and we're in it, then hide it; else jump to it; otherwise create it if it doesn't exit.
Use universal arguments, e.g., ~C-u 5 C-t~, to have multiple shells and the same universal arguments to pop
those shells up, but ~C-t~ to pop them away.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package shell-pop
  :config (setq
    ;; This binding toggles popping up a shell, or moving cursour to the shell pop-up.
    shell-pop-universal-key "C-t"

    ;; Percentage for shell-buffer window size.
    shell-pop-window-size 30

    ;; Position of the popped buffer: top, bottom, left, right, full
    shell-pop-window-position "bottom"

    ;; Please use an awesome shell.
    shell-pop-term-shell "/bin/zsh"
 ))
#+end_src

Now that we have access to quick pop-up for a shell, let's get
a pretty and practical shell: [[https://www.howtogeek.com/362409/what-is-zsh-and-why-should-you-use-it-instead-of-bash/][zsh]] along with the [[https://ohmyz.sh/][Oh My Zsh]] community
configurations give us:

1. ~brew install zsh~
2. ~sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"~

   This installs everything ^_^

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Be default, Emacs please use zsh
;; E.g., M-x shell
(setq shell-file-name "/bin/zsh")
#+end_src

Out of the box, zsh comes with
- git support; the left side indicates which branch we're on and
  whether the repo is dirty, ✗.
- Recursive path expansion; e.g., ~/u/lo/b TAB~ expands to ~/usr/local/bin/~
- Over [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins#apache2-macports][250+ Plugins]] and [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes][125+ Themes]] that are enabled by simply
  mentioning their name in the ~.zshrc~ file.

The defaults have been good enough for me, for now ---as all else is
achieved via Emacs ;-)

** Publishing articles to my personal blog
I try to [[https://alhassy.github.io/][blog]] occasionally, so here's a helpful function to quickly
publish the current article to my blog.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key global-map "\C-cb" 'my/publish-to-blog)

(cl-defun my/publish-to-blog (&optional (draft nil) (local nil))
  "
  Using ‘AlBasmala’ setup to publish current article to my blog.
  Details of AlBasmala can be found here:
  https://alhassy.github.io/AlBasmala/

  Locally: ~/alhassy.github.io/content/AlBasmala.org

  A ‘draft’ will be produced in about ~7 seconds, but does not re-produce
  a PDF and the article has a draft marker near the top. Otherwise,
  it will generally take ~30 seconds due to PDF production, which is normal.
  The default is not a draft and it takes ~20 seconds for the live
  github.io page to update.

  The ‘local’ optiona indicates whether the resulting article should be
  viewed using the local server or the live webpage. Live page is default.

  When ‘draft’ and ‘local’ are both set, the resulting page may momentarily
  show a page-not-found error, simply refresh.
  "

  (load-file "~/alhassy.github.io/content/AlBasmala.el")

  ;; --MOVE ME TO ALBASMALA--
  ;; Sometimes the file I'm working with is not a .org file, so:
  (setq file.org (buffer-name))

  (preview-article :draft draft)
  (unless draft (publish))
  (let ((server (if local "http://localhost:4000/" "https://alhassy.github.io/")))
    (async-shell-command (concat "open " server NAME "/") "*blog-post-in-browser*"))
)
#+end_src

** Excellent PDF Viewer
Let's install the [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] library for viewing PDFs in Emacs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; First: (async-shell-command "brew install --HEAD dunn/homebrew-emacs/pdf-tools")

;; Then:
(use-package pdf-tools
  :ensure t
  :config
  (custom-set-variables
    '(pdf-tools-handle-upgrades nil))
  (setq pdf-info-epdfinfo-program "/usr/local/bin/epdfinfo"))

;; Finally:
(pdf-tools-install)

;; Now PDFs opened in Emacs are in pdfview-mode.
#+end_src

Besides the expected PDF viewing utilities, such as search, annotation, and continuous scrolling;
with a simple mouse right-click, we can even select a ‘midnight’ rendering mode which may be
easier on the eyes. For more, see the brief [[https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2bc1is][pdf-tools-tourdeforce]] demo.
* Conclusion
Emacs   is   fun ^_^

Bye!
