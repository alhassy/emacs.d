* Why?

I have so many things installed, I'm forgetting some of the stuff
that I installed to be more productive! Whence this “personal” cheat sheet.
---I'm not trying to be comprehensive; see the existing cheatsheets for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][Emacs]]
and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/orgcard.pdf][Org]].

:More:
There are already cheatsheets for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf][Emacs]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/orgcard.pdf][Org]], and even [[https://github.com/alhassy/ElispCheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf][Elisp]];
so why bother with another one? The general ones are great but contain
stuff I rarely use, such as information on registers, but are missing
stuff I'd like to know, such as Helm keybindings which are not shipped with Emacs.

Below are the bindings that are shipped with Emacs or the packages one installs.
To be somewhat useful to others, my personal bindings will be “enclosed” in quotes.
I will write ~X,Y-x,y~ to denote one of ~X~ or ~Y~ followed by one of ~x~ or ~y~; e.g.,
~C,M-d~ denotes ~C-d~ and ~M-d~ --for character and word deletion, respectively.
Hopefully this makes it easier to group related commands.

As always, since I've installed ~which-key~, it suffices to press a prefix
then look at the resulting menu 😃

| ~C-x {,}~ | Shrink, widen window            |

# @@latex:\vspace{-1em}@@
Using ~C-x 5 ...~ in place of ~C-x ...~ operates on the
‘frame’ level --i.e., other Emacs GUI instances.
~C-x 4 ?~ is for acting on the other window, where
~? = f, d, b~
for finding file, directory, buffer.
Perhaps most useful is ~C-x 4 c~ for working with
different parts of the same buffer.

:More_on_C_x_4_c:

C-x 4 c clone-indirect-buffer-other-window.
It splits the current window, clones the current buffer and visits the clone in the newly opened window.

~C-x 2~ splits and copies the current buffer, but it's inappropriate for
looking at one part of the buffer while working on another part since
every editing change happens live, including superficial visual changes
such as region folding and narrowing.
Instead, we select the region we're working on, for example,
then press ~C-x 4 c C-x n n~ to clone the buffer then to narrow
the region we're working on.

  - ~t, d~ toggle timestamps and diff display.
  - ~M-{,}~ Go to previous, next branching point.
  - ~q~ Exit at currently selected state.

+ ~C-x r U~ Restore saved buffer state.    

Save & restore is useful for experimenting with
a function definition, for example.

:Rmrk:
Undo Tree also has functions which save an undo state to a register and which restore a save state from a register. These are bound to C-x r u and C-x r U by default. These are great for things like experimenting with a function definition.

~C-l~ reorients the buffer so that the current line is at the
top/center/bottom of the screen. Whereas ~M-r~ moves the point
to top/center/bottom without recentering the window.
