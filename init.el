If you have a call `(f x y)' then `(üò¥ f x y)' behaves the same but is run
when Emacs has been idle for 10 seconds.

E.g., (setq hi 12) defines a variable `hi', so `M-: hi' shows a value.
Whereas (üò¥ setq hello 12) does not immediately define a variable: `M-: hello' yields an error
when run immediately, but yields a value when Emacs is idle for 2 seconds.

Save the name of this macro by highlighting it and pressing `C-x r s z', then use it with `C-x r i z'.

================================================================================

Using `macrostep-expand' we can verify the following approximations:

‚áí (use-package foo) ‚âà (require 'foo)
‚áí (üò¥ use-package foo) ‚âà (use-pacakge foo :defer 10)
‚áí (use-pacakge foo :defer t) ‚âà nil ;; It doesn't load the package!
  ‚≠Ü Of-course, since I have ‚Äú:ensure t‚Äù implicitly, such declaration ensures
    package foo is installed.

================================================================================

This should be used as a last resort. Instead prefer `use-pacakge' lazy loading instead.

‚ùå Avoid :preface, :config, and :init since they unconditionally load the package immediately.
   ‚áí Favour :custom over :init; i.e., replace (use-package foo :init (setq x y)) with (use-pacakge foo :custom (x y)).
   ‚áí If you must use :init, add a ‚Äú:defer t‚Äù clause as well, to load it when it's needed.
   ‚áí If your :config only sets keybindings, then prefer :bind or :bind-keymap.
‚úÖ Prefer auto-loading keywords :bind, :hook, and :mode since they defer loading a package until it's needed.
  ‚áí These all imply ‚Äú:defer t‚Äù.
‚úÖ Prefer loading modes only after Emacs‚Äô initialisation has finished.
  ‚áí Replace (use-package foo :config (foo-mode + 1)) with (use-package foo :hook after-init)
  ‚áí Note (use-package foo :defer t :config (foo-mode + 1)) isn't lazy even though there's a :defer, since
    the :config clause forces the mode to load.

(defmacro org-deftag (name args docstring &rest body)
  "Re-render an Org section in any way you like, by tagging the section with NAME.

That is to say, we essentially treat tags as functions that act on Org headings:
We redefine Org sections for the same purposes as Org special blocks.

The ‚Äúarguments‚Äù to the function-tag can be declared as Org properties, then
the function can access them using the `o-properties' keyword as in
   (-let [(&plist :file :date :color) o-properties]
       (insert \"%s: %s\" file date))

Anyhow:
ARGS are the sequence of items seperated by underscores after the NAME of the new tag.
BODY is a form that may anaphorically mention:
- O-BACKEND: The backend we are exporting to, such as `latex' or `html'.
- O-HEADING: The string denoting the title of the tagged section heading.
- O-PROPERTIES: A plist of the Org properties at point.

DOCSTRING is mandatory; everything should be documented for future maintainability.

The result of this anaphoric macro is a symbolic function name `org-deftag/NAME',
which is added to `org-export-before-parsing-hook'.

 'variable
 "
 Entries are of the form (headline . options)
 ‚Üí HEADLINE is a string of the shape ‚Äú‚ü®Org Property‚ü©:‚ü®Prompt‚ü©‚Äù.
 ‚Üí OPTIONS are strings of the shape ‚Äú‚ü®Numeric Score‚ü© -- ‚ü®Label‚ü© -- ‚ü®Note‚ü©‚Äù.
   ‚áí When omitted, we have an open-ended question.
   ‚áí If ‚ü®Label‚ü© ends in ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù, then when it is chosen, a follow-up prompt starts to allow
     me to provide an alternate ‚ü®Note‚ü© value. The entire option, including the new ‚ü®Note‚ü©,
    is then written as the value of ‚ü®Org Property‚ü© in an Org heading.

A special entry is ‚Äú :random ‚Äù. All entries after it are considered optional
and 2 of them are randomly selected as part of the daily review.

üò≤ ‚ü®Org Property‚ü© names need not be unique:
If there are multiple entries sharing the same Org Property name,
then only one of them is randomly selected in the questionnaire.

üò≤ Moreover, ‚ü®Org Property‚ü© names may be space-separated strings:
Spaces are replaced with a visual space ‚Äú‚ê£‚Äù. It seems Org Property
syntax allows some Unicode to appear as part of the name; but not
the Unicode space ‚Äú¬†‚Äù. For example, the following runs with no problem:

   (org-set-property  \"look-ma-‚àÄ‚ê£p‚ààPeople‚ê£‚Ä¢‚ê£‚àÉq‚ê£‚Ä¢‚ê£q‚ê£ùë≥ùí™ùìãùê∏ùîñ‚ê£p\" \"üò≤\")

****** TODO ‚ü®3‚ü© Prioritize and schedule!    [0%]

0. [ ] For the ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù list, have others completed their tasks?

   - Agenda view: The list of to-do or waiting tasks without SCHEDULED or DEADLINE


1. [ ] *Check Calendar*. Look at company calendar for the upcoming 2 weeks;
   add items to your todo list if needed.

2. [ ] Find relevant tasks: What are my ‚Äúsprint goals‚Äù and ‚Äúquarterly goals‚Äù?
   - What is assigned to me in Jira /for this sprint/?
   - Any upcoming deadlines?
   - Look at your ‚ÄúSomeday/Maybe‚Äù list to see if there's anything worth doing.
   - get an overview about what you want to achieve in near future: your time
     and energy are finite, tasks are not
     - /Getting a sight of the forest can be very energizing and inspiring too,
       while the endless trees can feel overwhelming or pointless./
     - Relook some of the more recently processed tasks. Task priorities may change
       as time progresses, and it is possible that with a huge onslaught of new
       tasks, some important, older tasks may be left incubating. It‚Äôs also possible
       that some tasks are no longer necessary.


3. [ ] Assign a [[https://radreads.co/10k-work/][dollar value]] to your work: $10 (low skill, not important), $100, $1k, and $10k (high skill, prized effort).
   (MA: Aside: Change priorities to be render like this?)

   The Zen To Done system recommends scheduling your Most Important Tasks ($10k)
   on your calendar each week so that by the end of the week you have completed
   something of significance. It ensures that the more important things get
   done.


4. [ ] To ensure the week is doable, add efforts to tasks for the week
   then ensure the effort estimate is actually realistic. Also check each
   day and ensure it's realistic!

   # You can also add that to the column-mode (org-columns) to get a quick overview for a file (leave with org-columns-quit). Customize:
   # (org-columns-default-format \"%25ITEM %TODO %3PRIORITY %TAGS %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM\")

   - [ ] Look at daily agenda view for the next week and make sure it'd doable and not
         overloaded! I don't want to keep pushing things since my days are unrealistic!


5. [ ] Decide your tasks for the week and time block your calendar.

     *Focus on important tasks! Not low priority no-one-cares ‚Äòfun‚Äô efforts!*

     *Embrace trade-offs.* You can't do it all. Realize that when you're
      choosing to do one task, you're saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to many other tasks. And
                              that's a good thing

     Finally, schedule time on your calendar to work on your tasks. This is
       called [[https://dansilvestre.com/time-blocking/][time blocking]]. Set alerts for critical tasks.
       - Look at all items with a deadline in the next month:
         Are they realistically broken down into doable tasks and scheduled?


6. [ ] Study the next week‚Äôs agenda: look at any important scheduled tasks or
      deadlines, and decide whether any preparatory work will need to be done.


 /By [[https://dansilvestre.com/weekly-planning/][planning your week]] in advance, you prevent distractions from ruining your
             day. You remain focused on your most important tasks./
