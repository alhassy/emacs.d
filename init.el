"Make a hydra whose heads appear in a pretty pop-up window.

KEY: Global keybinding for the new hydra.

TITLE: Either a string or a plist, as specified for pretty-hydra-define.
       The underlying Lisp function's name is derived from the TITLE;
       which is intentional since hydra's are for interactive, pretty, use.

       One uses a plist TITLE to specify what a hydra should do *before*
       any options, or to specify an alternate quit key (:q by default).

BODY: A list of columns and entries. Keywords indicate the title
      of a column; 3-lists (triples) indicate an entry key and
      the associated operation to perform and, optionally, a name
      to be shown in the pop-up. See DEFHYDRA for more details.

For instance, the verbose mess:

    ;; Use ijkl to denote ↑←↓→ arrows.
    (global-set-key
     (kbd \"C-c w\")
     (pretty-hydra-define my/hydra/\\t\\tWindow\\ Adjustment
