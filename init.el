- When text is selected, use that as the link description --and prompt for link type
- When a URL is in the clipboard, use that as the link type
- On an existing Org link, prompt to alter the link then to alter the description
- With a ‘C-u’ prefix, prompts for a file to link to.
  - It is relative to the current directory; use ‘C-u C-u’ to get an absolute path.

It fallsback to `org-insert-link' when possible.
